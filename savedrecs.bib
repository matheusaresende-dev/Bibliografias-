Abstract = {Software Engineering (SE) education presents many challenges, especially
   related to hands-on activities that aim to improve practical skills and
   competencies to solve real-world problems. Some new Learning Approaches,
   such as Flipped Classroom (FC), emerged and can improve learning
   processes in this scenario. This doctoral work explores the Flipped
   Classrooms ideas, identifies challenges, and proposes a tool for
   reducing them, thus contributing to improved software engineering
   teaching research. Furthermore, the study aims to combine Adaptive
   Learning and Flipped Classroom approaches to offer study guides
   personalization and positively impact SE students' learning during
   outside classroom studies.},

Abstract = {Flipped learning revolutionizes the classroom by priming learners with
   course content before in-person sessions, enabling valuable class time
   for active learning. While a decade of research uncovers domain-specific
   outcomes, we share our ongoing experience implementing the Flipped
   Classroom model across nine Engineering and ICT courses at Auckland
   University of Technology (AUT). Our paper outlines the design process,
   reflecting on its execution. Courses were infused with Flipped Classroom
   and Active Learning pedagogies for one semester. The practical nature of
   engineering courses facilitated in-class engagement but posed challenges
   for pre-class involvement. Nevertheless, the approach garnered
   enthusiasm from both students and educators, fostering advocacy and
   sharing of its benefits. Future steps involve gathering student feedback
   and lessons learned to refine subsequent iterations.},

Abstract = {Flipped teaching is an approach which is becoming increasingly popular.
   There are already various field reports and scientific findings in
   different educational institutions and subjects. The approach of flipped
   teaching also appears to be promising in the university subject of
   software engineering. This paper explores the question of how this
   approach can be evaluated in teaching areas such as software engineering
   in comparison to traditional teaching approaches. A long-term study is
   presented in which courses with flipped teaching and courses without
   flipped teaching are compared. In total, 11 courses were analyzed over a
   period of six years (N=157). The results show that flipped teaching in
   software engineering has great potential and is rated better by students
   than traditional teaching in many areas. At the same time, the study
   also raises questions, for example, it is not clear from the results
   that active involvement is higher in flipped teaching than in
   traditional teaching.},

Abstract = {Contribution: A flipped classroom approach to teaching empirical
   software engineering increases student learning by providing more time
   for active learning in class. Background: There is a need for
   longitudinal studies of the flipped classroom approach in general.
   Although a few cross-sectional studies show that a flipped classroom
   approach can increase student learning by providing more time for other
   in-class activities, such as active learning, such studies are also rare
   in the context of teaching software engineering. Intended Outcomes: To
   assess the usefulness of a flipped classroom approach in teaching
   software engineering. Application Design: The study was conducted at an
   international master's program in Sweden, given in English, and
   partially replicated at a university in Africa. Findings: The results
   suggest that students' academic success, as measured by their exam
   grades, can be improved by introducing a flipped classroom to teach
   software engineering topics, but this may not extend to their subjective
   liking of the material, as measured by student evaluations. Furthermore,
   the effect of the change in the teaching methodology was not replicated
   when changing the teaching team.},

Abstract = {Student-centered teaching approaches emphasize student responsibility
   and learning. Flipped learning is a student-centered approach to
   promoting student learning. In this paper, we describe a flipped
   learning strategy that involves fostering collaborative, problem-based,
   and project-based learning in engineering courses. In addition, we
   delineate the role of student assessment and teacher-student
   interactions in the flipped learning teaching strategy. In this study,
   we compare academic achievement and student perceptions of instruction
   in a lecture-based and a flipped classroom. The results show that the
   students in a flipped classroom had higher grades than those in a
   lecture-based classroom. In addition, students in the flipped classroom
   assessed the learning materials, activities, and evaluations more
   positively than the students in the lecture-based classroom did.
   Students in the flipped classroom were also found to be more likely than
   those in the other class to perceive that they could apply the knowledge
   and skills they developed in the course. They also had higher motivation
   to learn than the students in the lecture-based class and perceived that
   the instructor generated a positive climate that fostered student
   participation.},

Abstract = {Simulation has been a long-time staple for industrial and systems
   engineering programs. Today's engineering students known as Generation Z
   (Gen-Z) exhibit specific generational traits including short attention
   spans and multi-tasking on multiple digital screens. These Gen-Z
   preferences have created new challenges and opportunities for the
   delivery of simulation methods and training in a classroom. In this
   paper, we present motivating factors and success in converting a
   software-intensive undergraduate-level simulation course to a flipped
   classroom setting. Furthermore, we present lessons learned from a
   multi-semester pilot study that investigated the impact of video length
   in lecture-length 40-50 minute vs. short-length 10-12 minute videos.
   Surprisingly, Gen-Z students preferred lecture-length videos. This paper
   shares our experience in transitioning from traditional to flipped
   classroom lectures for teaching simulation to Gen-Z engineering
   students. We share student feedback about the transition process, key
   tips for communicating expectations and deliverables, and how to
   minimize video burnout.},

Abstract = {Flipped learning is a developing concept in higher education and a new
   methodology ready for exploration. It is a new educational strategy that
   changes the traditional lecturing by flipping the classroom in the sense
   of listening the lectures at home and doing dynamic, group-based
   problem-solving activities in the classroom. This will engage the
   students in active learning, critical thinking and developing new
   studying skills.
   This paper will address the current state of knowledge and practice in
   the flipped learning approach in engineering education by critically
   evaluating the existing researches and summarizing the findings. The
   search for empirical articles included electronic databases for
   engineering education in the Web of Science. Most studies reported high
   student satisfaction and increased performance in a flipped classroom
   environment. This paper will also serve as a guide for future studies
   and reflect the major achievements of flipped learning models over the
   traditional lecture-exercises model in engineering education to support
   and advance the student learning process.},

   in a modular flipped classroom model, faculty, teaching the course for
   the first time, can benefit from the developed content. They can use and
   make improvements to modules based on their areas of expertise without
   affecting the entire course. The paper provides the perspective of a

Title = {A flipped mode teaching approach for large and advanced electrical
   engineering courses},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {413-426},
Abstract = {A fully flipped mode teaching approach is challenging for students in
   advanced engineering courses, because of demanding pre-class preparation
   load, due to the complex and analytical nature of the topics. When this
   is applied to large classes, it brings an additional complexity in terms
   of promoting the intended active learning. This paper presents a novel
   selective flipped mode teaching approach designed for large and advanced
   courses that has two aspects: (i) it provides selective flipping of a
   few topics, while delivering others in traditional face-to-face
   teaching, to provide an effective trade-off between the two approaches
   according to the demands of individual topics and (ii) it introduces
   technology-enabled live in-class quizzes to obtain instant feedback and
   facilitate collaborative problem-solving exercises. The proposed
   approach was implemented for a large fourth year course in electrical
   power engineering over three successive years and the criteria for
   selecting between the flipped mode teaching and traditional teaching
   modes are outlined. Results confirmed that the proposed approach
   improved both students' academic achievements and their engagement in
   the course, without overloading them during the teaching period.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom model is an instructional model in which students
   learn basic subject matter knowledge prior to in-class meetings, then
   come to the classroom for active learning experiences. Previous research
   has shown that the flipped classroom model can motivate students towards
   active learning, can improve their higher-order thinking skills, and can
   improve their collaborative learning skills. However, most current
   studies focus on students' experiences with flipped classroom learning.
   Because so few studies address the instructor's perspective, and
   instructors' perspectives on technology integration can directly
   influence their practice of incorporating technology in instruction,
   this study sought to focus on instructors. This paper is a qualitative
   case study that reveals instructors' experiences and perspectives on
   using the flipped classroom model in instruction. Structured interviews
   were conducted with eight faculty members who either previously had used
   or planned to use the flipped classroom model. Findings include
   instructors' perceived definitions of the flipped classroom, how they
   improved teaching and learning by using the flipped classroom model,
   their perceived benefits and challenges of the flipped classroom, and
   perceived approaches of using it in an effective way. The participants
   also recommended peer assistance among instructors as valuable support
   to implement the flipped classroom model in instruction successfully.},

Abstract = {Mathematics is an important topic for computing and engineering
   students, but students often find the subject challenging, which
   emphasises the importance of using effective pedagogical strategies. The
   constructivist approach of the flipped classroom, where students learn
   new content out of class, and practice problems and engage in discussion
   in class, is raising in popularity. However, it is seldom reported how
   such an approach is used for teaching mathematics in the context of
   computing courses. This paper reports the experience and findings of
   implementing a flipped classroom approach for a foundation university
   module titled `Mathematics for Technology'. A flipped classroom approach
   is shown to be successful in this context, but there are key
   considerations for its implementation. This includes factors such as
   constructive alignment, the desired learning and assessment outcomes,
   and the disposition of the student cohort. Recommendations are provided
   for practitioners who may be interested in implementing the flipped
   classroom approach in a similar context.},

Abstract = {MOOCs have made it possible not only to provide quality open education
   for any learner worldwide, but also to rethink the way on-campus
   teaching is delivered. The materials produced for a MOOC can be consumed
   by on-campus students before arriving to the classroom, using class time
   to do activities that promote active learning, following this way a
   flipped classroom strategy. This paper presents the experience of
   redesigning a first-year engineering course with a large number of
   students (over 400 each year), in which MOOCs are reused, and a flipped
   classroom strategy is implemented, dedicating most of traditional
   lecture time to do hands-on, interactive activities. The results show an
   increase in students' motivation, both in the use of MOOC content
   outside the classroom, and in the realization of hands-on, interactive
   activities inside the classroom. In relation to the teacher, having
   information on students' previous work outside the classroom, and on
   students' work in the hands-on, interactive activities carried out
   inside the classroom, allows understanding better the differences
   between groups, tailoring the explanations during class time, and
   providing proper reinforcement activities to be done after class.},

Abstract = {Background To address some challenges that the large lecture-focused
   courses have faced in higher education, the flipped classroom model was
   implemented in mechanical engineering. The purpose of the study was to
   investigate mechanical engineering undergraduate students' performance
   in the flipped classroom. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to
   investigate the pedagogical benefits of active learning in the flipped
   classroom from a self-determination theory perspective. To evaluate the
   effectiveness of the flipped classroom, students' academic achievements
   in the flipped classroom were compared with the ones in the traditional
   lecture format. Moreover, to explore in-depth students' learning
   experiences and their perceptions about the flipped classroom, students'
   open-ended surveys were analyzed. Results Results demonstrated that
   students in the flipped classroom performed better and favored the new
   model, feeling that flipped classroom was useful and helpful in
   preparing for the course. The qualitative findings showed that students
   felt that they benefited from the pre-week online lectures in the
   flipped classroom to prepare for the course. Conclusions The current
   study shows that the flipped classroom model has the potential to create
   an autonomy-supportive learning environment and provide beneficial
   learning experiences. This study highlights the benefits of and future
   direction for implementing the flipped classroom in traditional
   mechanical engineering courses.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to explore student-content,
   student-interface, student-instructor, and student-student interactions
   in a flipped classroom (FC)-based undergraduate engineering course using
   the transactional distance (TD) theory. Understanding student
   interactions that occur in and out of the classroom to reduce the TD can
   help one design and develop high-quality FC-based courses and, thus,
   produce better learning outcomes and teaching experiences. A
   mixed-methods case study was implemented in a Probability and Statistics
   course, and 37 undergraduate students from a developing university's
   faculty of engineering participated in the study. Data were collected
   via an anonymous online survey and focus group interviews. The initial
   findings indicated that the FC approach facilitated the students'
   learning process and increased their interest in the course.
   Furthermore, the students found favorable student-content,
   student-instructor, student-interface, and student-student interactions.
   Based on the findings, all interaction types and their relationship with
   each other in the scope of the FC approach were discussed.
   Recommendations for reducing the TD include preparing videos that are
   understandable and comprehensive enough to be studied by students,
   provision of sufficient support, and positive attitude to students by
   instructors, encouraging collaboration among students, and utilizing
   easy-to-use digital platforms.},

   quasi-experimental, with a quantitative approach. An independent
   variable and another dependent variable were defined. The hypothesis
   accepted is that the educational process was improved thanks to the
   developed proposal. The studied population was 73 students. A survey was
   developed for data collection previously validated by an ethics
   committee. Serious drawbacks are revealed in the Flipped Classroom that
   affect all actors in the process. For 92\% of the students, the

Title = {A Comparison of Flipped and Traditional Classroom Learning: A Case Study
   in Mechanical Engineering},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {34},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1876-1887},
Abstract = {The flipped classroom has been introduced to promote collaborative
   learning and higher-order learning objectives. In contrast to the
   traditional classroom, the flipped classroom has students watch
   prerecorded lecture videos before coming to class and then ``class
   becomes the place to work through problems, advance concepts, and engage
   in collaborative learning{''}. In this paper, the active flipped
   learning was applied in engineering mechanics class to combine flipped
   classroom with active learning in order to establish an active flipped
   learning (AFL) model, aiming to promote active learning. Eighty
   sophomores engineering students, most of whom are African-American
   students, participated the active flipped learning. To compare the
   effect of AFL, the traditional teaching was applied in the first half
   semester and pre- and post-tests were used to evaluate their learning
   performance. After the mid-term exams, five flipped models were applied
   to five topics. All of the students attended these flipped models. Pre-
   and post-tests were conducted for the AFL. The survey results were
   analyzed to compare students' learning self-efficacy and satisfaction
   between the traditional and the active flipped classroom. Compared to
   the traditional classroom, students' learning motivation is obviously
   enhanced in the AFL classroom, with students' interest, curiosity and
   learning initiatives in curriculum promoted, intrinsic goal orientation
   further strengthened, in which students tend to have less extrinsic goal
   orientation and lower test anxiety than the students in the traditional
   classroom, but with improved control beliefs and self-efficacy for
   learning. In the traditional classroom, students use more rehearsal and
   elaboration strategies, while in the flipped classroom, students use
   more organization strategies and prefer to use critical thinking
   strategies to raise relative questions about teaching content and video
   materials. Students in the AFL model use more strategies of resource
   management, such as time and study environment, effort regulation, peer
   learning, and help seeking than in the traditional model. In comparison
   of different student groups, the AFL model effectively improves
   students' motivation in both long and short learning time groups, but
   the effects are not obvious on the low GPA students. From the
   perspective of gender, the AFL model helps to increase the male
   students' learning motivation, while female students use more learning
   strategies in task value, control belief and self efficacy in
   traditional model. Therefore, the instructors should pay more attention
   in improving the learning motivation and effectiveness of low GPA group
   and female students in the flipped classroom. In summary, the AFL model,
   by taking advantage of advanced technology, is a convenient and
   professional avenue for engineering students to strengthen their
   academic confidence and self-efficacy in Engineering Mechanics by
   actively participating in learning and fostering their deep
   understanding of engineering statics and dynamics.},

Abstract = {Flipped teaching and learning approaches are being increasingly used in
   higher education. Some advantages associated with the approach include
   providing opportunity for self-directed learning and enhanced
   collaboration between students. In this study, an implementation of a
   flipped approach in a first year foundational engineering dynamics
   course was researched to investigate student views on independent and
   collaborative learning inherent in flipped learning. Eighteen
   undergraduate students (11 male and 7 female) participated in this
   qualitative study. The flipped part of the course was designed to
   include self-paced independent learning and in-class learning, with
   opportunities to collaborate, ask questions, and work on examples. Data
   were collected using semi-structured interviews. The results of the
   study indicated that students universally enjoyed learning independently
   and appreciated the increased collaboration induced by the flipped
   approach. The flexibility of the approach enabled a range of approaches
   to independent learning and collaboration, and students were able to
   find learning styles that suited them. This article concludes with a
   range of recommendations for practice to further support independent and
   collaborative learning with the use of flipped approaches.},

Abstract = {The concepts of conducting flipped classroom are basically the same, yet
   the teachers still consider it too difficult to switch from traditional
   lecture to flipped classroom, due to the lack of practical model. This
   paper mainly evaluates three different technological courses that
   adopted the flipped classroom approach for one semester in The
   University of Hong Kong, according to the ``Seven Principles for Good
   Practice in Undergraduate Education{''} proposed by Chickering and
   Gamson. The guidelines of good practices gleaned from the cases and
   suggestions for improvements proposed by authors in flipped classroom
   design is described, according to the seven principles. It is hoped that
   the findings in this paper can inspire on-campus teachers in the
   teaching and learning design in flipped classroom.},

Title = {A quasi-qualitative analysis of flipped classroom implementation in an
   engineering course: from theory to practice},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Students have different learning approaches and acquire knowledge in
   different ways owing to their varied perceptions and grasping abilities.
   Treating students equally, following the traditional teacher-cantered
   approach, may not be effective and calls for innovations in knowledge
   dissemination. This article takes a student-centric approach to
   implement a `flipped classroom' model in an engineering course for
   constructivism (i.e. experience-based learning), and students'
   personalized learning. The performance of the flipped classroom approach
   is compared with the traditional lecturing approach using four lenses:
   students' grades, students' reflection using three surveys at different
   stages during the semester, teacher's observation, and peer observation.
   In most of the existing approaches, analysis of the qualitative survey
   data is performed manually without computer assistance, and therefore
   these are criticized for being primeval and instinctive. In this
   research, a novel approach, based on fuzzy logic, is devised to evaluate
   the qualitative survey responses from the students. It is shown in this
   research, that the linguistic survey responses can be summarized in an
   index more meaningfully using a fuzzy logic-based approach. The results
   further showed that the flipped classroom model helped students to
   improve their grades and enhance engagements with their teacher and
   their peers. Increased interaction, during interactive class activities,
   was instrumental in evolving students' problem-solving and critical
   analysis skills towards better learning experiences. Furthermore,
   students' survey results, analyzed using the novel fuzzy indexing and a
   non-parametric statistical test showed that the intervention in the form
   of flipped classes was effective and found to be statistically
   significant. The findings of this study may help other academics,
   endeavoring for experience-based, and students' personalized learning.},

Abstract = {The recent movement to integrate the flipped classroom model into higher
   education has resulted in significant changes that affected both
   teaching and learning practices in different ways. After almost a decade
   of research on the flipped classroom model, different emergent outcomes
   have been reported in a domain specific context. To gain a comprehensive
   understanding of the flipped classroom implementation in a university
   context, a review of the literature on the use of flipped classroom in a
   university context was conducted. This study was guided by interpreting
   the previous research findings according to the domain of utilization,
   opportunities, challenges, and extensions to the conventional flipped
   classroom model. This study found that the utilization of flipped
   classroom in various disciplines is mainly advocated to promote
   students' engagement, metacognition, attitude, performance,
   understanding, and achievement, as well as other learning outcomes. The
   key challenges of this method, shared across all disciplines, were
   devoted to the length of the video/digital materials and time required
   for instructors to prepare the learning materials and for students to
   master it. Recommendations for policy makers and other crucial insights
   for the future studies were highlighted.},

Abstract = {The growth of information technology has led to the introduction of
   blended learning classrooms. A ``flipped{''} classroom is a specific
   type of blended learning environment that allows students to learn
   outside the classroom through e-learning and then interact with the
   teacher inside the classroom. Although flipped classrooms have many
   advantages, some issues, such as low motivation prior to lectures,
   remain and should be improved. This paper proposes an in-flipped
   classroom to overcome the problems found in existing flipped classrooms
   and evaluates this type of classroom using a Database Engineering course
   in a master's program. This study uses the College and University
   Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI) to investigate the learning
   performance of the newly proposed in-flipped teaching environment. The
   results show that students in an in-flipped classroom exhibit better
   individualization than those in a traditional classroom and have
   increased interest in cooperative learning. The study also finds that
   students are more easily engaged in lectures and develop self-directed,
   self-regulating, and self-determined skills through the proposed method.},

Abstract = {The learner-centered teaching concept and the flipped classroom teaching
   method are effectively combined to become an important mode for today's
   mixed teaching reform. The ``rain classroom{''} has provided an
   effective platform for the combination of the two. First of all, we use
   the ``rain classroom{''} teaching platform and take a course as an
   example to study the learner-centered flipped classroom teaching reform
   design. The main teaching methods are grading of ability level,
   after-school study group, case study, and online and classroom
   interactive Q\&A. Secondly, through the investigation of students'
   learning ability and willingness to learn, the teaching framework is
   designed to be suitable for students to learn and for teachers to teach
   students according to their aptitude. Finally, by paying attention to
   the real-time feedback of the effect of students using the flipped
   classroom, this paper proposes problems that should be paid attention to
   when implementing the flipped classroom. The results show that the
   course has been successful after its setup and implementation. The
   learner-centered teaching method, which respects the ability level
   classification of learning initiative, can complement the after-class
   content with the classroom content, and effectively improve the teaching
   and learning effects.},

   incorporates the Visual, Auditory, Read and Kinesthetic (VARK) learning
   styles in a Flipped classroom which improves the higher order thinking
   skills of the learners. Higher order competency skills like
   Problem-solving, Critical thinking, and Creative thinking were assessed
   in the cloud-based Flipped classroom. MALAR competency for PCC
   (Problem-Solving, Critical Thinking, and Creative Thinking) competency

Abstract = {This is a fact that the education is changing, and more teachers are
   getting involved in this changing process leaving behind old teaching
   methods. This new form of teaching is based on the personalization of
   learning with the help of digital tools, and on the application of
   inclusive methodologies that require active and responsible
   participation of the students. This work presents the flipped classroom
   methodology as a tool to improve the performance of engineering
   students. In particular, patterns and benefits of this teaching
   methodology are presented in the subject of Physics of Installations in
   the Construction School, where traditionally the results show a high
   level of fails and through the introduction of the flipped classroom a
   significant improvement has been noticed. The followed patterns can be
   exported to other subjects of scientific-technological field that
   present difficulties for students.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom model is an innovative educational trend that has
   been widely adopted in the social sciences but not engineering
   education. In this model, an active instructional approach shifts the
   educational strategy from a teacher- to a student-centred approach. The
   purpose of this study is to compare the learning outcomes of engineering
   students attending a flipped-model section of the Dynamics of Structures
   course with students attending a traditional, lecture-based section of
   the same course taught by the same instructor. The results confirm
   previous research showing that test scores in the flipped course
   sections were slightly higher than traditional sections. Although the
   improvement in test scores was statistically insignificant, student
   statements indicated that the flipped model promoted a deeper, broader
   perspective on learning, facilitated problem-solving strategies and
   improved critical-thinking abilities, self-confidence and teamwork
   skills, which are needed for a successful engineering career.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a flipped classroom approach followed to teach
   systems analysis, design and implementation at university level. The
   techniques employed are described. These techniques were underpinned by
   a theory of coherent practice: a pedagogy that provides a framework for
   the design of highly structured interventions to guide students in their
   learning experiences. The paper also describes the students' perceived
   benefits and limitations of the approach. Overall, the flipped classroom
   approach had a positive impact on students' attitude to learning, level
   of understanding, ability to apply concepts and engagement. Limitations
   were mostly in line with a reluctance to take charge of their own
   learning (for some of them) and inability to engage in group
   discussions. A set of recommendations are proposed to address these gaps
   in line with what has been prescribed in literature.},

Abstract = {In earlier work, we presented the results of an initial study on the
   effectiveness of the flipped classroom model in the programming portion
   of a first year engineering course. Here we present results of an
   additional study we conducted to determine whether our earlier results
   can be replicated if the flipped class is used for the whole course. We
   extended the use of the flipped class to not only cover programming but
   also include the course topics of engineering design, project
   management, statistics, dimensions and conversions, technical
   representation of data and engineering ethics. We compared student
   performance on traditional quizzes and lab assessments in the flipped
   classroom version to data collected from the previous term where only a
   portion of the course was flipped and an earlier traditional running of
   the course. Data collected on student usage of learning material, grades
   and surveys was consistent with previous results. Students were able to
   adjust to the unfamiliar flipped classroom model, with the majority
   preparing for the class beforehand using the provided learning
   materials. The flipped class also resulted in similar improvements in
   assessment results when compared to previous runnings of the course.
   Lastly, students here too perceived the flipped class to be beneficial
   to them from a learning perspective and assisted them in the course
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is a methodology recognised for its positive
   impact on the self-regulation of learning and academic performance.
   There is extensive literature that demonstrates its potential for
   educational flexibility, including the adaptation to online and blended
   modes of delivery that utilize digital technology successfully. There
   is, however, little evidence which proves that a unique flipped
   classroom design can be adjusted to different teaching modes without
   affecting student satisfaction and learning outcomes. In this research,
   we analyse eight cases of flipped classroom implementation during the
   2020-2021 and 2021-2022 academic years in the Faculty of Education
   Sciences at Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona. According to the
   findings, students who seem to have a stronger perception of
   self-regulated learning development and technology appropriation also
   have higher perception of academic performance, although they do not
   achieve better results. There are no significant variations in
   pedagogical design satisfaction or learning outcomes depending on
   teaching modality. However, the study did find that the most flexible
   teaching modes, such as intermittent face-to-face and hybrid teaching,
   offered more benefits to students in terms of academic performance and
   self-regulated learning. The main conclusion is that flipped classroom
   is a flexible methodology that can be adapted to different teaching
   modes while maintaining student satisfaction and learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {A flipped classroom teaching approach has been used in the teaching of
   college algebra within a broader initiative for mathematics learning.
   The flipped classroom approach documented in this chapter utilizes
   multiple teaching strategies to enhance student learning. From the pilot
   teaching of two semesters of college algebra, a teaching model was
   developed using the Joyce, Weil, and Calhoun (2009) framework. The
   purpose of this study and chapter is to describe the design and

Abstract = {In the novel teaching model of the Flipped Classroom, the teaching
   sequence of transferring and internalizing knowledge is completely
   reversed. Before class, the knowledge is transferred to students using
   modern information technologies. In class, the requirement of the
   internalization of knowledge is reached through teacher explanations,
   student group discussions, etc. According to the changes in teaching
   models, the various elements of teaching will also change. The purpose
   of this paper is to try to construct a Flipped Classroom teaching model
   that suits the actual situation of the classroom based on the
   characteristics of the Flipped Classroom, and to analyze some problems
   in the process of implementation in order to provide a new idea for the
   innovation and reform of the current teaching model.},

Abstract = {Flipped learning is a pedagogical approach that creates a dynamic and
   interactive learning environment. It has been used in Software
   Engineering (SE) course to give students more time for doing their work
   under teacher supervision during in-class learning. This paper presents
   student perceptions toward the use of flipped learning in SE course. The
   results indicate that this approach gives a good impact on students'
   understanding and practical skills. The perceptions were measured on
   several aspects, i. e. (i) the suitability of flipped learning for the
   course, (ii) student's engagement to the course, and (iii) the quality
   of teacher supervision during the in- class time. Students indicate
   positive perceptions on all those aspects.},

Abstract = {A recurring issue we observe with traditional teaching methods in basic
   software engineering courses at KU Leuven is poor engagement of students
   that may result in superficial knowledge. To investigate and tackle this
   issue, we designed a responsibility-centered learning approach using
   flipped classroom. Flipped classroom is a pedagogical approach that has
   shown to enhance student engagement in the learning process. We designed
   a flipped classroom approach centered on enhancing student's
   responsibility in the learning process, targeting the specific
   challenges of poor engagement of students in the courses. The approach
   combines guided self-study of the learning material with student-driven
   elaboration of the material during deepening sessions. We have applied
   the approach in a basic software engineering course in two academic
   years. Student feedback of the first year indicated that the workload
   was perceived too high, so we adapted the approach for the second year
   resolving this issue. The experience shows that flipping the classroom
   had no direct effect on study results, but, by making students owners of
   the learning process, they report that the approach fosters their
   engagement and enables them to obtain deeper understanding of the course
   material.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom is a strategy that began to be used at the higher
   education as a measure to improve the performance and motivation of
   students. As one of the first activities of the research project in
   which this article is framed, a search was made of the state of the art
   of the flipped classroom in higher education. For this, a systematic
   review of the scientific literature was carried out, with the aim of
   knowing if the flipped classroom methodology is applied in higher
   education, what tools are used and if they correspond to Web 3.0. On the
   other side, it was analyzed whether the application of this methodology
   generates competencies, such as: learning continuously and autonomously;
   perform effectively in work teams; solve engineering problems and
   effectively use application techniques and tools in engineering; which
   correspond to the competencies sought in the project under analysis. The
   article presents the results of the systematic review, which shows that
   the flipped classroom is applied in engineering education, that
   different tools are used but that this implementation must have certain
   considerations to be applied successfully, such as: the correct planning
   of the activities to be carried out by both the students and the
   teachers, the knowledge of both actors about the methodology to be used,
   among others.},

Abstract = {An interdisciplinary approach can improve both functional and aesthetic
   design skills for undergraduate engineering students. In this paper, we
   designed and compared two flipped engineering classrooms, one involving
   only engineering students who worked on individual design tasks, and the
   other including groups of an engineering student and an art major
   student that performed design tasks collaboratively. Fifty-one
   engineering students, 29 from the individual flipped classroom and 22
   from the interdisciplinary flipped classroom participated in the study.
   During the semester, all students studied pre-recorded video lectures
   and homework before the class and then participated in weekly
   engineering design activities either individually or in a group.
   Students' motivational experiences and engineering design achievement
   were assessed at the end of the semester. The results showed that
   students' preferences in employing motivational regulation between the
   two flipped classrooms were different. Also, the students participated
   in the interdisciplinary flipped classroom exhibited higher aesthetic
   design achievement.},

Abstract = {A main issue in higher education is actively engaging students in the
   formation of their ideas transforming teaching in a way of mediating
   learning. In this context, flipping the classroom is a challenging
   proposal suggesting the replacement of teacher led instruction with
   in-class activities for students that focus on higher-level knowledge
   processes. Aiming to take advantage of the flipped classroom in engaging
   students in Machine Design, we decided to flip part of the correspondent
   undergraduate course following specific design principles. In class
   students worked individually and in groups on several types of problems,
   participating also in a peer review activity. The pre-course content was
   consisted of existing material, videos, texts and appropriate URLs. This
   was delivered through a wiki on the wikispaces platform. Preliminary
   results of this pilot study provide evidence about the potential of the
   flipped classroom method for higher engineering education.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom is a student-centered methodology that can help
   engineering students to acquire the cross-curricular skills demanded by
   society. However, its effectiveness relies on the commitment of both
   instructors and students. In particular, this strategy requires students
   to work on a number of proposed activities before face-to-face classes.
   Then, in order to follow the most appropriate path in those classes,
   instructors need a reliable way to know at which degree their students
   worked on those proposed activities, what issues they encountered while
   doing them and which concepts need to be reinforced in class. This paper
   presents a case study of a flipped-classroom undergraduate engineering
   course. By using data-driven learning design and learning analytics
   techniques we show that: (1) by delaying their work on the course
   activities our students actually drove the course towards the
   traditional approach; (2) despite directly asking students at the
   beginning of a face-to-face class might seem to be an appropriate way of
   getting reliable information about their previous work, it may lead
   instructors to erroneous conclusions; (3) our students were strongly
   mark- and deadline-oriented, but even a small grade encouraged them to
   work on the assignments; (4) the gathering and checking of students'
   learning data before the class can help instructors to tailor the lesson
   design; and (5) if students did not work on pre-class activities,
   dedicating a small amount of time of the in-class lesson to explain the
   most difficult concepts can help students to be more efficient with
   their work, at the cost of losing some of the spirit of the flipped
   classroom.},

Title = {Impact of Flipping a First-Year Course on Students' Ability to Complete
   Difficult Tasks in the Engineering Design Process},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},

Abstract = {The impact of flipping an engineering course on student learning
   outcomes remains an open question because the literature presents a
   perplexing array of results. In this multi-year study, we evaluate the
   impact of flipping a first-year project-based engineering design course.
   We pose two questions: (1) Does a flipped project-based engineering
   design course produce different levels of mastery of engineering design
   process knowledge compared to the lecture version of the course? (2) Do
   students in the lecture class and flipped class achieve the same levels
   of design process knowledge when given tasks that range in difficulty?
   Three strands of data were used to assess design process knowledge:
   first drafts of team technical memos, pre- and post-critiques of a Gantt
   chart of a proposed design process, and an exam. Teams in the flipped
   classroom performed significantly better on the technical memos that
   evaluated solution ideas and established a testing plan, both of which
   required high-level cognitive capacities. However, no differences were
   found between lecture and flipped models for the exam or technical memo
   that established design criteria, which required low-level cognitive
   activities. The Gantt chart assessment produced mixed results. This
   study concludes that flipping a project-based design course can
   significantly improve student learning on more difficult tasks. We urge
   researchers and educators to consider the tasks and assignments given to
   students when drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of flipped
   pedagogy.},

Abstract = {Flipping a classroom is an innovative teaching method in itself. This
   method faces additional challenges when the students are not actually
   engineering majors. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the
   development, implementation, and assessment of a flipped classroom for a
   thermal-fluids course for non-engineering majors.
   Problem solving is a critical component of engineering education; an
   engineering student cannot only read problem statements or solely attend
   a lecture. However, duration of student contact in the classroom is
   constrained by credit hours. In a local survey, most students indicated
   that they would not take the time to complete not-for-grade problems on
   their own after class. For many of these students, graded homework
   assignments are the first and only experience they have in solving
   complex engineering problems prior to exams. By only receiving lectures
   and struggling to work homework problems individually, it is arguable
   that few of these students are able to progress beyond the lower tiers
   of Bloom's taxonomy. Historical time survey data suggests that the
   students conduct little to no daily preparation when there are no graded
   requirements and conversely show extremely large time spikes when out of
   class assignments are due or prior to in-class evaluations. Finally,
   in-class lectures force an instructor to teach a certain amount of
   material in a limited timeframe irrespective of the rate at which each
   student can retain or comprehend that information regardless of the
   experience level of the student.
   Inspired by the pedagogical concept of `flipping the classroom,' Khan
   Academy online instructional videos, and the Thayer Method (whereby
   students prepare prior to class, recite the topic to their instructors
   and receive daily evaluations) the authors created a blended course.
   This blended course leveraged the digital age through video lectures
   before class and combined it with traditional engineering problem
   solving in class. The goals of this blended course are as follows:
   improve the quality and efficiency of student learning by conducting
   lectures outside of class and homework during class; allow
   non-engineering students to learn each lesson's material at their own
   pace and provide a valuable study tool for exam preparation; increase
   the time spent in classroom solving problems with instructors; leverage
   one-on-one time in the classroom where the instructor can better
   approach each individual's issues; encourage and enable non-engineering
   students to take more responsibility for their learning and become
   lifelong learners; and inspire intellectual curiosity in the field of
   engineering. The instructors developed a preliminary beta test for the
   initial third of an undergraduate introductory course in thermal-fluid
   systems and kept the remainder of the course unchanged from its
   traditional lecture method to gain student feedback. This feedback was
   used to develop a completely blended course consisting of
   non-engineering majors; the results of which are studied and presented
   in this paper.},

Abstract = {Engineering is a field marked by critical thinking, problem solving, and
   application of vast amounts of scientific and technical knowledge.
   College-level engineering courses often focus on learning scientific
   material and are challenged to provide an opportunity for students to
   apply this material or develop the above skills necessary for success in
   the field. Because of this disconnect, a teaching method known as the
   flipped classroom is gaining consideration and implementation in
   engineering classes as well as in classrooms of many levels and
   disciplines. In a flipped classroom, live class lectures are moved out
   of classroom and replaced with on-line videos, and active, project-based
   learning activities are done in their place. At the University of
   Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania State University two sustainable engineering
   courses focused on residential energy efficiency were flipped, and the
   impact this method had on the students was investigated.
   For this study, data was collected using pre- and post-confidence tests,
   a final course reflection survey, and the College and University
   Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI). This data was then analyzed and
   used to develop conclusions on the students' perception of the flipped
   classroom teaching method and the course. Students in both courses
   frequently expressed that they learned various personal skills such as
   leadership, listening, and communication, which were consistent with
   class objectives. The tones of the student responses were positive, and
   on the CUCEI, the students scored the class environment above average.
   The highest scoring section of the CUCEI, 4 out of 5, was
   Personalization, which includes professor availability and highlights
   how a flipped classroom provides students with more opportunity to
   interact and connect personally with the teacher. As expected, the
   Involvement section, pertaining to student participation in in-class
   activities and class discussions, also scored high at 3.94 out of 5.
   Student comments were generally positive such as, ``It was great that
   there was always time in class to ask about the module and topics I
   didn't understand,{''} or, `` I thought it created a more comfortable
   learning environment in class and allowed students to learn in their own
   way at home.{''} Our findings suggest that the flipped classroom was a
   successful teaching method for these sustainable engineering courses.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is an innovative and increasingly popular
   pedagogical approach in higher education. It emphasises student learning
   responsibility, deeper learning, differentiated instruction and more
   efficient use of class time. However, despite its increasing popularity
   across disciplines, few studies have elaborated on strategies for
   implementing a flipped classroom beyond its essential elements. The
   present study thus proposed a three stage collaborative instructional
   model (3-CI), an extension of the classic flipped classroom model. A
   case study approach was adopted to investigate 3-CI's effectiveness
   through students' perceptions in Research Methods in Educational
   Technology, with 29 graduate students. Results show that 3-CI increases
   participants' satisfaction, engagement and collaboration. Furthermore,
   3-CI design strategies, which emphasise collaboration and
   student-centredness, can help college educators to incorporate the
   flipped approach into their teaching practice.},

Abstract = {This paper outlines an ongoing study of the flipped classroom with
   second and third-year undergraduate engineering students in a numerical
   methods course. The flipped classroom is a new pedagogical method, which
   employs asynchronous video lectures and practice problems as homework,
   and active, group-based problem-solving activities in the classroom. It
   represents the combination of learning theories once thought to be
   incompatible-active, problem-based learning activities founded upon
   constructivist ideals and instructional lectures derived from direct
   instruction methods founded upon behaviorist principles. Using a
   controlled quasi-experimental research design, we conduct a study with a
   full 15-week numerical methods course at Utah State University during
   the spring semester of 2013. Students in the experimental section
   completed model-eliciting activities inside the classroom and video
   lectures and homework outside the classroom. Students in the control
   section completed homework outside the classroom and group lectures
   inside the classroom. The two groups will be compared using scores from
   homework, examinations, and a sixteen-question numerical methods
   conceptual pre-post-test pair. The three main features that distinguish
   this study from previous research are: 1) This is a controlled study; 2)
   This study examines student performance on objective measures; 3) This
   study uses model-eliciting activities in the experimental classroom.},

Abstract = {Flipped or inverted classroom is one of the upside down pedagogies,
   which combines different learning theories. Its learning design
   constitutes already well-known components: video lectures and
   activities, both structured in a novel way. The proposed research
   targets are to increase the understanding and scalability of flipped
   classroom implementation. It is an attempt to plan the course transition
   in a more effective way. To achieve this goal, 9 window design
   approaches and the Flipped Classroom Design Approach (FCDA) are used.
   The preliminary results describe the initial a flipped classroom model
   with its connections, impacts and a list of parameters as one element.
   The model is adapted to the transition of the course of System Modelling
   from the Traditional to a flipped form. Further on, it can be used by
   teachers as an algorithm at the stage of flipped classroom planning,
   design, development and implementation. Practically, the current results
   appear in a guided FCDA approach with the template and supporting online
   learning materials.},

   this study, the flipped model was applied to a junior level civil
   engineering course, Structural Analysis, with the goal of increasing
   student learning and success. A statistical analysis of the attainment
   of the student learning objectives (i.e., student learning) determined
   mixed results. Of the seven learning objectives for the course: four
   increased, two decreased, and one decreased less than one percent. The
   study found that the flipped model had a positive effect on student
   success. There was a 7.9\% increase in students who earned a C grade or

Title = {Student satisfaction with courses and instructors in a flipped

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING},

Volume = {36},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The flipped classroom model challenges the way educators structure and
   implement their courses, and how students learn. Although there is
   burgeoning evidence for the effectiveness of flipped classrooms for
   improving student performance, student satisfaction is also an important
   consideration insofar as student evaluations can affect uptake of new
   education approaches. Yet we know little about the extent to which
   students are satisfied with the flipped model. To address this
   discrepancy, this article reports a world-first meta-analysis of student
   satisfaction with flipped classrooms and teachers relative to
   traditional teaching approaches across disciplines and education level
   (overall 53 studies; 8,429 students). Overall, the flipped classroom had
   a weak-moderate positive effect on student satisfaction with courses (k
   = 50; g = 0.36) and instructors (k = 26; g = 0.40). We also report
   moderating effects relating to discipline, education level, pre-class
   testing, in-class activities, group size, and sophistication of flipped
   designs.
   Lay Description
   What is already known about this topic
   Implications for practice and/or policyWhat this paper adds
   The flipped classroom model is now widely employed around the world
   There is increasing evidence that it is associated with improved student
   performance, relative to traditional teaching approaches
   Student satisfaction with teaching has implications for student
   motivation and performance; teacher-related outcomes; and institution
   recruitment and funding
   Reports a world-first meta-analysis of effects of the flipped classroom
   model on student satisfaction, relative to traditional teaching
   approaches (overall 53 studies; 8,429 students)
   The flipped classroom has a weak-moderate positive effect on student
   satisfaction with courses (k = 50; g = 0.36) and instructors (k = 26; g
   = 0.40)
   Even a classroom that is only `minimally' flipped is associated with
   higher levels of student satisfaction, relative to traditional teaching
   models
   Flipped classroom designs should be encouraged on both pedagogical and
   pragmatic grounds; in the case of the latter, students prefer a flipped
   classroom approach
   Students are likely to respond positively to teachers and institutions
   who employ a flipped classroom approach},

Abstract = {although flipping classroom is not a new idea in education, implementing
   flipped class is somewhat a new trend. Flipping classrooms involve
   students in using their textbooks, online materials, and other useful
   resources before coming to class. Consequently, students can spend
   valuable class meetings on problem-solving activities instead of
   lectures. Positive feedback from utilizing the flipped classroom
   techniques has been reported in several papers. This article presents an
   attempt to implement the flipped classroom for a large introductory
   engineering class in multivariable calculus at King Mongkut's Institute
   of Technology Ladkrabang. The results from implementing the flipped
   classroom both quantitatively and qualitatively showed a higher
   performance and more positive feedback when compared to those obtained
   from this class taught by the same instructor using the traditional
   classroom format in the previous year.},

Abstract = {Flipped Classroom mode is a new teaching mode, which not only reflects
   `student-centered' teaching concept but also changes traditional
   teaching structure and process, drives bold innovation of teaching
   methods and learning approaches and is of great significance for
   realization of personalized teaching. This thesis starts with
   introducing source of the Flipped Classroom mode and studies teaching
   design and application of the Flipped Classroom mode.
   The Flipped Classroom is also called `inverted classroom' and `reverse
   classroom', which is a new teaching mode where roles of teachers and
   students in traditional teaching are changed and classroom time is
   re-planned by arranging knowledge instruction and knowledge
   internalization reversely. In the Flipped Classroom mode, students need
   finish learning knowledge at home by themselves and classroom is the
   site where teacher-student and student-student interactions are
   implemented. Being affected by many factors, China has not popularized
   the Flipped Classroom mode but only practiced and tried it at several
   schools of pilot teaching reform up to now. Therefore, it is essential
   to enhance cognition and comprehension about the Flipped Classroom and
   rethink about whether domestic education needs the Flipped Classroom or
   not in order to construct localized development paths of the Flipped
   Classroom teaching mode.},

   increases in retention and persistence.
   Objective: The following study analyzed the impact of a flipped
   classroom intervention in a numerical analysis course teaching MATLAB
   programming taught to students not majoring in a computer-related
   engineering discipline.
   Method: Performance in the flipped classroom was compared to historical
   performance in the traditional classroom. Participants? intrinsic
   motivation was also investigated to try to understand the difference
   seen between semester offerings of the course.
   Findings: Student performance improved among students participating in
   the flipped classroom approach. Intrinsic motivation did not impact
   performance in the flipped classroom.
   Implications: Our work provides further evidence of the efficacy of
   flipped classroom approaches for teaching introductory programming. This
   work also highlights the importance of considering incoming knowledge
   and maturity when selecting flipped classrooms for educational contexts.},

Abstract = {In this paper we report our study on the impact of implementing a
   flipped classroom model on student learning in an undergraduate
   introductory programming course. We use three components to measure
   student learning namely, final exam scores, competency acquisition and
   feedback levels. We compare a traditional offering with a flipped
   offering delivered the following year to a comparable student
   population, and with no change in the course content and assessments. We
   observed that in comparison to the traditional, the flipped model
   increased pass rates in the final exam and also enhanced competency
   acquisition. In terms of feedback levels, the flipped classroom provided
   more time for one-to-one in-class personalized feedback. Our approach is
   unique in the sense that we use a competency framework to be able to pin
   point the competencies that were improved as a result of the flipped
   model.},

Abstract = {This case study aims to investigate the extent to which the teaching
   mode called flipped classroom is effective in enabling students to learn
   fundamental concepts in cost engineering. It adopted a repeated measure
   design and statistical evaluation to examine the learning approaches
   that enabled students to master fundamental concepts. It also identified
   the teaching modes that are effective in helping students to understand
   and apply fundamental concepts in solving cost engineering problems. The
   flipped classroom involved students learning one fundamental concept
   (TC1) via preclass online video clips in their own time, followed by
   in-class discussion, and applying the fundamental concept in solving
   problems in a face-to-face (F2F) tutorial setting. Thereafter, they were
   tested for their mastery of TC1. As a comparison, the same students were
   taught another fundamental concept (TC2) via the traditional F2F lecture
   and tutorial settings. The study was repeated in the following academic
   year, with the teaching methods for TC1 and TC2 switched. The data
   collected included presurveys and postsurveys of perceived learning
   approaches, pretests and post-tests, and final examination results. This
   case study found that students achieve mastery (measured by final
   examination marks) of fundamental concepts regardless of whether the
   teaching mode is traditional lectures or flipped classroom. When
   students adopted a more surface-motive learning approach, they also
   performed significantly more poorly, regardless of teaching mode.
   Students who adopted a more deep-strategy learning approach when taught
   in flipped classroom mode performed better in final assessment. The
   finding is important because it reveals that the flipped classroom is
   just as effective as the traditional classroom in helping students to
   master certain cost engineering fundamental concepts. It is recommended
   that instructors consider using the flipped classroom to harness
   technology in education. Students are advised not to adopt surface
   learning approaches because these are detrimental to their mastery of
   cost engineering concepts.},

Abstract = {Recent technological advances have stimulated flipped learning across
   disciplines. This pedagogical model, a specific type of blended
   learning, frees up classroom time for interaction and higher-order
   activities. While the traditional flipped model had been limited to
   putting video lectures online to encourage practice activities in the
   classroom, it has evolved to allow for diverse models and approaches
   that suit the needs of individual disciplines, courses and modules. This
   study compares two traditional interpreting classrooms with two flipped
   ones, followed by a thorough examination of the latter to explore
   effective flipping strategies. The classes were conducted at a graduate
   school of interpretation and translation; for the flipped classrooms, a
   variety of teaching and learning activities were flipped in light of
   their pedagogical contexts and objectives. The Community of Inquiry
   (CoI) instrument was employed to investigate how students perceive their
   traditional and flipped learning experiences.},

Abstract = {A hybrid flipped course has been used for two years in a first year
   engineering course at Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ, USA. In the Fall
   2013 semester there were 12 sections of 20 - 25 students. The course is
   considered a ``hybrid{''} because the textbook and a majority of the
   homework exercises are delivered online. The course is considered
   ``flipped{''} because students are quizzed (online) on the course ebook
   before material is covered in class. This allows instructors to focus on
   more advanced and active learning during class time.
   The purpose of this paper is to describe the hybrid flipped course
   format in detail, focusing on the ebook and online homework. The results
   of surveys of students and instructors are used to explore the
   functionality of hybrid flipped courses.
   Levels of satisfaction with the online aspects of the course were high
   amongst students and teachers. Pathfinder was somewhat successful at
   getting students to prepare for class, primarily by creating an
   atmosphere of expected preparation, which was accentuated by the fact
   that graded online exercises were required prior to class. While a
   number of active learning techniques were employed in the Fall 2013
   semester, more are envisioned for future course offerings.},

   increased role of technology, as well as the rapid advancement of

   active learning in supporting flipped instruction, the value of prior
   experience as a concomitant variable, and the benefits and limitations
   of the approach. Examination of findings supports this new method of
   instruction and learning; however, some student hesitance to move beyond
   traditional instruction suggests a need to implement the approach as a
   continuum, beginning with segments, then moving to a blended technique,
   with final transition into a totally flipped classroom. This process
   supports instructor development and student buy-in while allowing for
   formative assessment of resources and increasing of student efficacy.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom teaching method, which emphasizes independent
   learning of theory and practical, in-depth exercises in the classroom,
   is gaining foothold in teaching. The method is increasingly being
   applied at university level. It has been implemented with varying
   approaches and guidelines, and a single unified process has not been
   described. In this article we compare existing literature to two case
   studies where flipped classroom was introduced to teaching. We discuss
   the lessons learned in these cases and present recommendations based on
   our experiences. Flipping the classroom has been found to be more
   efficient than traditional lecture-exercises method and the findings in
   this study support this. Therefore we recommend teachers to explore the
   possibility of utilizing the flipped classroom method in their courses.},

Abstract = {Some of the new teaching models that have emerged, including the Flipped
   Classroom, can be key to reversing traditional educational practices.
   However, it is necessary to analyse in detail how these educational
   experiences are being implemented in the classroom, and how this is
   affecting students' learning. The present research uses a case study
   methodology. The objective is to analyse a higher education course
   taught using flipped classroom methodology and to assess the impact of
   the implementation of said pedagogical model on the students' formative
   process. The study used a data collection instrument based on a
   structured interview and a data analysis strategy based on the Grounded
   Theory. In general, the results show that students tend to express
   positive opinions and a good degree of satisfaction with their
   experiences with this pedagogical method. Most students confirm that the
   method successfully stimulates cooperative learning and favours the
   practical acquisition of knowledge, stimulating in turn the development
   of a series of key competences in the educational process, along with
   capabilities such as organisation, autonomy and responsibility, among
   others.},

Abstract = {The Flipped classroom methodology is becoming increasingly prevalent at
   the primary and secondary education levels. At the university level, the
   feasibility and tests of this learning methodology are progressively
   being carried out, it is in this context that the work presented in this
   article has been carried out. The objective of this article is to
   analyze the experience on Flipped class in a theory group with 75
   students, taught during the course 2016-17, in the subject Programming 1
   of the Degree on Computer Engineering of the University of Alicante. It
   was proposed to use the flipped methodology instead of the traditional
   classroom during the 15 weeks of the first semester.
   In this article, starting from the methodological proposal Flipped, a
   review of different experiences on Flipped classroom in the university
   level is made. Next, the Flipped classroom scheme and the technological
   base that has been used in the methodological experience with this group
   are established. We compare the results of evaluation obtained in this
   group with the results of groups taught by the same faculty in previous
   years and, in addition, the opinion of the students obtained through an
   anonymous survey is provided. To finish this work, the positive and
   negative aspects of the methodological experience are analyzed from the
   point of view of the teaching staff, and the guidelines are provided in
   which future experiences can be advanced.},

Abstract = {With the advent of new technologies and the move for faculty to
   implement these into their teaching practice, a new model for course
   design and delivery has developed called the flipped classroom model. As
   more instructors investigate this model, the benefits, which include
   classroom management, active learning, critical thinking, and maximum
   use of student-faculty time together, become obvious. With classroom
   sizes increasing, more instruction moving online, and resources
   dwindling, the flipped classroom model can be an improved model for both
   instruction and quality learning. Research supports the benefits of the
   flipped classroom, but the change from a traditional classroom model to
   a flipped model requires a pedagogical shift on the part of both teacher
   and learner.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the findings on `flipping the classroom' pedagogy
   for one selected topic in the Software Engineering module. A flipped
   classroom is a form of blended learning where the lecture is moved
   outside the classroom with the help of technology and learning
   activities are moved inside the classroom. The students typically watch
   instructional videos outside of the classroom but participate in
   learning activities with other students in class. This allows students
   to learn on their own time and pace outside class time while enabling
   the lecturer to enhance interaction, collaboration and higher-order
   thinking of students by monitoring individual learning and task
   performance. Our past experience has shown that using the traditional
   approach to teach software engineering, which is a heavily conceptual
   and theoretical subject, can be challenging. Against this backdrop, we
   have devised a flipped class room trial to let the students carry out
   the learning activities before coming to class where they then share and
   apply the knowledge during face-to-face lessons for more engaging
   learning experience. As this is an initial trial, the author has chosen
   a topic that is relatively easy to understand and with support of
   interesting videos readily available online. The purpose is to motivate
   the use of flipped classroom for appropriate topics taught in Software
   Engineering curriculum.},

Abstract = {Teaching of programming foundations has been subject of several
   investigations, because it is believed that the required activities can
   contribute to the development of students more able to solve problems
   and to adapt to any environment or situation. Some works have argued
   about the integration of Flipped Classroom and Problem-Based Learning in
   Computer Science courses to potentiate this kind of teaching, but fewer
   evidences that investigate the real application between these approaches
   were found. Thus, in order to enhance the Flipped Classroom in-class
   activities, this paper reports an experience to implement and apply
   Flipped Classroom and Problem-Based Learning approaches for a CS1
   course. Additional concepts of programming contests, group formation and
   learning styles were also used. In general, the main findings suggest
   that the Flipped Classroom model, if well-planned and carefully
   designed, can benefit students. However, these initial benefits are more
   related to student's motivation and social behavior than those
   associated with grades and the effective learning. Results also indicate
   that PBL may be an adequate approach to enhance the face-to-face time in
   the inverted classroom.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the operative steps to implement the flipped
   methodology in traditional teaching in the context of a higher
   education. As a result, we could attest that the success of the design
   of a flipped classroom depends on the alignment of what a teacher wants
   for students before, during, and after the class. Defining the scope of
   learning is also important in order to guide teachers and to make clear
   to students what is expected from them. Planning is crucial in order to
   determine what and how much of the subject can be taught within the time
   frame. Furthermore it is important not to try teaching ``everything{''}
   with lower development of cognitive objectives being better to have
   fewer contents and develop deeper objectives such as a critical analysis
   or creativity. Usually, outside the class students develop lower levels
   of cognitive work, via reading or watching videos and in-class they
   focus on higher forms of cognitive work, harder work of assimilating
   knowledge, solving problems, debating or discussing some controversial
   issues, where they have the support of their peers and instructor.},

Abstract = {Adoption of new practice only occurs if the proposed change is perceived
   as being beneficial and if the challenges associated with implementing
   the new practice are not overwhelming. The teaching method of flipping
   the classroom is a newer practice that has received a lot of attention
   in current literature, where the potential benefits are thoroughly
   discussed. The challenges associated with flipping the classroom are
   more obscure in the literature. The purpose of this chapter is to
   outline challenges associated with flipping the classroom and propose
   solutions to overcome each of the challenges described. Challenges of
   implementing a flipped classroom can occur at the institutional or
   individual level and can be categorized as technological or
   non-technological. Specific challenges to be discussed include
   technology delivery challenges at the organizational and individual
   level, lack of technical support, IT infrastructure challenges,
   inadequate technical and non-technical training resources for
   instructors, instructor and student resistance to using non-traditional
   teaching methods, the inability to assess student comprehension using
   traditional strategies, increased course preparation time, and lack of
   student preparation or buy-in.},

Abstract = {This study surveyed 84 undergraduate students, majoring in education, in
   order to gather their perspectives regarding flipped classrooms and
   investigate their readiness levels for flipped learning. After the
   implementation of flipped learning for an entire semester, surveys were
   distributed in two flipped classrooms that were taught by the same
   instructor. Students showed particular preferences for the ``Bring Your
   Own Device{''} and the Instant Response System features of the flipped
   classroom. Approximately 60\% agreed with the idea of flipped
   classrooms, but only 39\% agreed that the flipped classrooms met their
   learning needs. Their readiness levels for flipped learning were
   moderately above the average levels, and males or juniors (compared with
   freshmen), felt more prepared for flipped learning. In general, course
   grades, self-directed learning readiness, and group work preference can
   predict the different readiness dimensions. The findings may enhance
   educators' understanding in how to apply the flipped learning model in
   ways that are most beneficial for their own students. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {In response to pedagogical challenges in higher education, blended
   learning has become a prevalent practice in colleges and universities.
   Flipped learning (FL) represents a newly emerging form of blended
   learning, where students individually watch online lectures prior to
   class and then engage in classroom learning activities interacting with
   peers and instructors. Although the conceptual framework of FL may be
   intuitively appealing, its design and implementation involve
   considerable intricacy. The purpose of this study was to develop a FL
   design model for higher education that could systematically guide
   instructors or designers in creating an appropriate blend of
   individualized online lectures and collaborative face-to-face learning
   activities. Using an established method for model development research,
   a theoretically constructed initial model was iteratively improved and
   underwent internal and external validation through model usability
   tests, expert review, and field evaluation. The implementation of an
   algebra class in a Korean university designed by the final model
   resulted in significant increases in the maturity of mathematical views,
   quality of reflections, and satisfactions of students. Features of the
   model are discussed, along with theoretical and practical implications
   and suggestions for further research.},

Volume = {66},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom approach is becoming increasingly popular. This
   instructional approach allows more in-class time to be spent on
   interactive learning activities, as the direct lecturing component is
   shifted outside the classroom through instructional videos. However,
   despite growing interest in the flipped classroom approach, no robust
   frameworks have been developed for the design or school/faculty-wide
   implementation of flipped classrooms. The aim of this article is to
   provide a foundation for the flipped classroom approach in Spector's
   (Foundations of educational technology: integrative approaches and
   interdisciplinary perspectives, Routledge, New York, 2016) model of six
   pillars of educational technology. After reviewing previous discussion
   of the flipped classroom approach, each pillar (i.e., communication,
   interaction, environment, culture, instruction, and learning) is
   discussed in the context of flipped learning. Using Spector's (2016)
   framework and drawing on relevant theories and empirical findings, 10
   recommendations are made. These recommendations are particularly useful
   for the school/faculty-wide implementation of flipped classrooms. As the
   foundational framework proposed in this article is only preliminary,
   further studies (e.g., design-based research) are recommended to
   increase the robustness of the design framework and ultimately improve
   educational practices.},

Title = {Incorporating concept development activities into a flipped classroom
   structure: using PhET simulations to put a twist on the flip},
Journal = {CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Implementation of the flipped classroom approach into STEM courses has
   been popularized in the last decade and has generally been reported to
   improve student performance outcomes. In a flipped classroom setting,
   students typically first encounter course content in the online format
   and subsequently engage in some form of active learning during the
   in-person class meetings. Although the flipped classroom approach can
   promote increased student engagement and provide an opportunity to apply
   content encountered in the classroom, this structure does not generally
   give students opportunities for discrete concept development prior to
   the application phase of learning. In an effort to build concept
   development activities into a flipped classroom structure, five learning
   cycle activities were implemented in a large enrollment first-term
   general chemistry course that has previously implemented the flipped
   classroom design. Four of these learning cycle activities incorporated
   PhET simulations as part of the exploration phase of learning, and all
   five activities were facilitated during the in-person class meetings to
   initiate the learning cycle. The activities were designed to help
   students explore models and engage in concept development. The
   application phase of the learning cycle was facilitated by flipped
   classroom modules or in-person classroom activities that included
   whole-class questioning coupled with collaborative think-pair-share
   discussion. Performance gains in conceptual understanding were evaluated
   by employing a one-group, pre-post-post research design. Non-parametric
   Friedman's tests indicate a significant main effect across time for each
   concept development activity, and post hoc Wilcoxon signed rank tests
   indicate the post-test and final exam scores are significantly higher
   than the pre-test scores for each activity (p < 0.001 for each pre-post
   and pre-final pairwise comparison). The findings reported herein
   demonstrate that concept development activities can be successfully
   integrated with flipped classroom modules and the combination of the
   introductory learning cycle activities and flipped classroom application
   activities led to knowledge gains that persisted through the end of the
   course. In total, creating this type of blended learning environment
   appears to help students achieve understanding of core general chemistry
   concepts.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom has shown a positive effect on academic
   performance and student satisfaction. However, there are relatively few
   studies that help us understand when or why this method has a positive
   effect on students, so as to aid the design of a flipped class. In this
   study, an instrument for assessing the student learning experience in
   flipped courses is proposed and validated, comparing the results of
   their application over two semesters in a university-level programming
   class with three flipped sections (n = 151) and four conventional ones
   (n = 226). We found that with a similar score in terms of learning
   experience, the achievement in a flipped course is slightly higher than
   in a lecture-based course, F(1,108) = 4.20, p = 0.04, d = 0.19. A
   multiple regression analysis was conducted for the effect on achievement
   of GPA, level of challenge, feedback and enjoyment. By controlling for
   these factors, students in flipped classes achieved higher scores than
   students in lecture-based courses, beta = 0.1, t(370) = 2.4, p = 0.02.
   The expected improvement in achievement increases when features of the
   flipped classroom improve the student experience. Our results suggest
   that the design of a flipped class should consider the effect of
   different implementation features on student experience in order to
   select the most appropriate ones for a particular context.},

Abstract = {Assuming the evident relationship between innovation and technology, and

   contemplates a systematic review on the resource on flipped classroom
   model in non-tertiary education. 181 studies were reviewed with the
   purpose of establishing and apprehending the connections between the
   flipped learning and its potential to promote curriculum innovation.
   Data analysis allowed the building of a three-level model in which the
   relations of the flipped classroom model and curriculum are organized in
   terms of (i) outcomes support, (ii) institutional change and (iii)
   classroom instruction modus operandi. Results suggest substantial
   potential of the flipped model to flip the curriculum and even the
   school culture. To meet such end, innovation must be perceived as an
   institutional strategy, making sure all stakeholders hold a part in the
   adaptative process of fostering change. Moreover, there is evidence that
   the model can ease the articulation and consolidation of constructivist
   approaches in schooling, a perspective that enhances the movement for
   student-centred logics in education. The review novelty lies on its
   building of a model that can work as a guide for reflecting on the
   approach and for underpinning future action.},

   come to classroom for active learning experiences. Previous research has
   shown that flipped classroom have a positive impact on students'

   investigated three higher education instructors' adoption of flipped
   classroom, with special focus on the adjustments they made and the
   suggestions they offered to make a successful flipped classroom course.
   Semistructured interviews and course artifacts were collected from the
   three instructors. Findings highlighted that they made a main adjustment
   on allocating a brief period of in-class time to address students'
   pre-class learning materials, and they suggested that helping students
   form good learning habits and integrating resources from other courses
   and other program activities into flipped classroom instruction can
   enhance the instructional efficiency. Findings also reveal that
   instructors look forward to more peer assistance among instructors.},

Abstract = {Flipped learning is necessary for modern education but quite difficult
   to implement. In pedagogical science, the question remains to what
   extent the practical work of the teacher in combination with the
   technologies of flipped learning will improve the quality of higher
   education. The aim of this article is to study the effectiveness and
   feasibility of using flipped learning technologies, assessing their
   perception by students (advantages and problems), identified an
   algorithm for introducing flipped learning technology in higher
   education institutions. Research methods. The main method is an
   experiment. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the study was
   conducted using a questionnaire and observation method. Statistical
   methods were used to evaluate the results of the experiment. The
   research hypothesis is that flipped learning allows the teacher to spend
   more time on an individual approach, to understand the real needs of
   students, and provide effective feedback, thereby improving the quality
   of learning and motivation of students, especially while studying
   complex material. The results of the study are to prove the
   effectiveness of the technology of flipped education in the study of

   strategies improves the self-regulation of the educational process,
   group work skills, improves students' ability to learn, overcome
   difficulties. The technology of flipped learning in the presence of
   modern technical means and constant work on improving the level of
   digital literacy is an effective means for students to master complex
   topics and problematic issues that require additional consideration and
   discussion. The perspective of further research is the consideration of
   integrated approaches to the application of flipped learning
   technologies to the principles of STEAM-education, multilingual and
   multicultural programs, etc. It is also worth continuing to develop a
   set of methods aimed at enhancing the student's learning activities, the
   formation of group work skills, direct participation in creating the

Abstract = {The following Research-to-Practice full paper presents the outcomes of a
   remote synchronous flipped classroom implementation of a senior-level
   data management course.
   As flipped classroom models of instruction have gained popularity in
   higher education, it has prompted the need for an investigation into
   content-specific methods for flipped curriculum design. Our work
   identified and implemented flipped classroom design factors in an
   Advanced Database Design (CIT 44400) course to address a gap in research
   around flipped classroom models within undergraduate data-science
   courses. Through literature review, we identified a set of eight factors
   of effective flipped classroom instruction and evaluated them via
   survey, focus group, course evaluation, student performance, and
   interview data.
   We segmented designed course activities which incorporated these eight
   factors with a set of learning objectives that emphasized collaborative
   iterative practices to position students as designers and evaluators of
   solutions to industry-authentic problems. Instructional design factors
   were evaluated via course evaluations and student surveys followed by an
   activity-based qualitative analysis of focus group, instructor
   interview, and student free-response data to understand student
   perceptions of instructional approaches, intended versus practical
   outcomes of such activities, and guidelines for future course design
   iterations and research. We argue instructional design must be
   studentcentered and consider student goals alongside those that are
   `scripted' into the course structure to best serve, motivate, and engage
   students. During the Fall 2020 implementation of CIT 44400, we
   prioritized learner independence, peer collaboration, and critical
   thinking in the instructional design, selecting flipped methodologies
   with the intention of fostering these skills in senior students. In
   light of Covid-19, the course was adapted to be synchronous online.
   Regardless of these unforeseen constraints, student performance and
   course evaluation data indicate that with peer and instructor feedback,
   students were able to apply course content appropriately in their final
   independent project as evidenced by a 12\% increase in assessment scores
   and an improvement in students average overall final course grades from
   a `B' to an `A-' as compared to the previously taught Fall 2019
   lecture-based section of the same class. Course evaluation scores also
   improved from 3.22 to 3.66 from Fall 2019 to Fall 2020.
   Self-reported survey data from students indicate that (a) feedback from
   the instructor, (b) small group work, (c) revision of work based on
   feedback, and (d) solution evaluations were the most positively
   impactful instructional design elements throughout the course. In
   particular, students mentioned oneon-one scaffolding from the instructor
   as beneficial for their learning. Students also communicated challenges
   faced during the pandemic, complaints, and recommendations for future
   course iterations. Data from focus group discussions conveyed that
   students (a) generally had positive learning experiences despite the
   constraints of learning exclusively online and (b) developed the
   industry-specific collaborative practices which were designed into the
   forefront of our instructional model. The flipped classroom design and
   implementation process in this research is transformative and can be
   employed by other STEM disciplines to design a domain-specific flipped
   model for their classroom which considers the needs of one's students,
   the challenges of the current time, and the state of the field at large.},

Abstract = {Digital learning has become more than just a trend in the modern world.
   Blended learning concepts are well established in different areas of
   application. An important concept in this domain is the so-called
   flipped classroom (FC). This approach repurposes class time to focus on
   application and discussion, while the acquisition of basic knowledge
   will happen at home, enabled by online lectures. In the past, research
   demonstrated and discussed the advantages of flipped classroom concepts
   within case studies. Still, standardized guidelines for the development
   of flipped classrooms are rare. However, it is necessary to learn from
   the past to improve future education. Thus, we analyzed reviews on
   flipped classroom research and used these to inductively develop a
   reference process model for the realization of flipped classroom
   concepts. The model is based on phases taken from project management,
   which help to structure the process and associated tasks. The results
   present the process model shown in Business Process Model and Notation
   (BPMN) and applicable checklists for the development of a FC course. The
   process model was applied and evaluated during the implementation of a
   flipped classroom at a university. Future research should concentrate on
   evaluation of the model as well as a deeper elaboration of upcoming
   roles and their tasks in order to derive further guidance for teachers
   and organizations.},

Abstract = {This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a framework to evaluate
   and design flipped classroom activities for data science and management
   courses. Variants of flipped classrooms have been employed in STEM
   fields with great success in students' learning outcomes. Research shows
   that flipped classrooms would improve students' learning if it is
   implemented following rigorous procedures of an efficient instructional
   design. As a result, one of the critical focus of current flipped
   classroom research is what factors educators need to consider when
   designing a flipped learning environment. Currently, educators
   incorporate various factors such as ``pre-recorded video lecture{''},
   ``group activity{''} as a trial and error basis and adjust these factors
   based on their own experience and students' feedback. On the other hand,
   the emergence of big data expects a new graduate to demonstrate mastery
   of concepts and skills for data acquisition, management, and analysis of
   inference from data when they enter the workforce. Currently, there is
   no systematic approach available to design a flipped classroom that is
   for the data science and management courses. In this research, we
   develop a framework first to investigate and evaluate the flipped
   classroom factors mentioned in the literature and identify a few that
   are most relevant to the two data management courses at our institute.
   Then, we classify each course topics into broader categories. So that
   the flipped classroom model can be developed for each category. For the
   flipped classroom for each category, we identify the pre-class and
   in-class activities to meet a certain learning objective for that topic
   category for each course. To evaluate the effectiveness of different
   factors as well as our flipped classroom models, students' performance
   data, interviews, and surveys are conducted. This process is
   transformative and can be employed by other STEM disciplines to find the
   most influential factors to design effective flipped learning
   classrooms.},

Abstract = {There has been a paradigm shift in the modern classroom from
   teacher-centered, in-class lecture in a physical classroom, to
   student-centered, blended learning in a flipped classroom. However, many
   university teachers are having difficulties in designing effective
   learning instructions or activities for a flipped course. Aiming to
   explore the validity of the flipped learning concept in a higher
   education context, an innovative flipped course was designed and
   implemented using an advanced learning platform to create a holistic
   flipped classroom environment. A survey, an interview, and computer
   system logs were used to evaluate the effectiveness of such a
   pedagogical method. It was found that the ``Holistic Flipped
   Classroom{''} approach was effective: students reported that they were
   satisfied with the course, their attendance improved, and their study
   efforts increased. It was also found that the transactional distance
   changed during the learning process: highly motivated students performed
   much better comparatively than less motivated ones. Although this
   approach has shown positive results, some students retained their former
   passive learning habits, and this became the main obstruction to full
   adoption. Finally, for the practitioner, case examples and suggestions
   are provided to address the design, implementation and adoption issues.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to answer the research question, ``How does the flipped
   classroom affect students' learning strategies?{''}. In e-learning
   research, several studies have focused on how students and teachers
   perceive the flipped classroom approach. In general, these studies have
   reported pleasing results. Nonetheless, few, if any, have attempted to
   identify the potential effects of the flipped classroom approach on how
   students learn. This study was based on two cases: 1) a business
   modelling course and 2) a research methodology course. In both cases,
   participating students were from information systems courses at Dalarna
   University in Sweden. Recorded lectures replaced regular lectures. The
   recorded lectures were followed by seminars that focused on the learning
   content of each lecture in various ways. Three weeks after the final
   seminar, we arranged for two focus group interviews to take place per
   course, with 8 to 10 students participating in each group. We asked open
   questions on how the students thought they had been affected and more
   specific questions that were generated from a literature study on the
   effects of flipped classroom courses. These questions dealt with issues
   of mobility, the potential for repeating lectures, formative feedback,
   the role of seminars, responsibility, empowerment, lectures before
   seminars, and any problems encountered. Our results show that, on
   completion of the courses, students thought differently about learning
   in relation to more traditional approaches, especially regarding the
   need to be more active. Most students enjoyed the mobility aspect of the
   flipped classroom approach, as well the accessibility of recorded
   lectures. However, a few claimed it demanded a more disciplined
   attitude. Most students expressed a feeling of increased activity and
   responsibility when participating in seminars. Some even felt empowered,
   because they could influence seminar content. The length of recorded
   lectures and the opportunity to navigate within them were also
   considered important. The arrangement of the seminar rooms should
   promote face-to-face discussions. Finally, the types of questions and
   tasks were found to affect the outcomes of the seminars. In conclusion,
   we found that, if students are to be active, responsible, empowered, and
   critical, they have to be informed. They also need to have the
   opportunities and mandate to influence how, where and when to learn.
   Finally, they should be able to receive continuous feedback during the
   learning process. A flipped classroom approach can support such a
   learning strategy.},

Abstract = {This chapter contains case studies from Education. Case study authors
   discuss ways to reduce cognitive overload, as well as methods for
   differentiating the student flipped learning experience, assessing by
   process and not just product. Several cases address the application of
   the ADDIE model in a ``constant cycle of design and evaluation.{''} Each
   case study opens with the instructional context and a rationale for
   flipping the classroom. The case study authors also describe the
   structure of the course, as well as descriptions about how they prepared
   their students for flipping, and an evaluation of the flipping
   experience from both the instructor and student perspectives.},

Abstract = {The challenge today is to create an educational environment in which a
   learner can learn optimally. Today technology is being integrated, but
   perhaps not in the most optimal way that can support student-learning
   (Dunlosky et al, 2013). Prior to the advent of learning technologies the
   mainstay of learning was the textbooks (including other paper resources)
   and traditional lectures. Learning technologies has given rise to a new
   pedagogical strategy called Flip-classroom. The Flip-classroom model is
   a pedagogy that involves utilising video content and quizzes/ exercises
   to replace the lecture and utilization of class time to solve problems,
   individually or in a group with the guidance of the teacher. This
   methodology increases the one-to-one interaction time with the students.
   Evidence suggests that for certain subject matter the Flip-classroom has
   resulted in more engagement and better results (Mason et al, 2013). This
   paper critically analyses, the Flip-classroom methodology in light of
   learning theories and published research literature. This may help
   educators understand the challenges and solve them appropriately. The
   challenge the Flip-Classroom method faces is the ability to deliver on
   the skills required today. The paper emphasizes that the educators need
   to create flip-classroom methodology to achieve the 21st century skills
   like creativity, problem-solving, critical thinking, communication and
   collaboration.},
