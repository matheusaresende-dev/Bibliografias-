Trust mediates the relationship between an organization's governance, leadership, people, and technologies. Trust in digital health depends on product/asset quality, competence and motivation of staff, client-facing organizational structures and activities addressing justice and equity, regulatory and compliance environment, organizational culture, and transparency of governance. Reciprocity underpins the mutually trusting and respectful cocreation process. It requires good governance, leadership, and management. Transparency emphasizes the openness of the system and technology to citizen participation in the cocreation process, engendering a sense of ownership and facilitating trust-building. Transparency and access must be balanced with cybersecurity across the micro-meso-macro-meta continuum to engender trust in digital data, tools, and services. The FAIR, CARE, and 5-SAFES principles described in Chapter 3 apply with a focus on sustainability. Inclusive leadership and governance that leverage corporate social and environmental responsibility activities can promote trust in the use of digital tools to improve individual and community health.}

abstract = {Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by demyelination and immune dysregulation. Despite the established link with immune function, the genetic and pathological mechanisms connecting immune-related genes to MS remain incompletely understood.
Methods
We systematically integrated genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for various quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from public databases and literature, along with GWAS summary statistics for MS from IMSGC and FinnGen. Mendelian Randomization (MR) was used to infer potential causal relationships between immune-related factors and MS. To validate whether the same genetic variants underlie both traits, Bayesian colocalization analysis was performed. Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) further supported causality between the exposure and outcome. Finally, two-step MR was conducted to investigate whether immune cell subsets mediate the observed associations.
Results
Fc receptor-like 3 (FCRL3) was identified as a protective factor for MS, supported by MR analyses at multiple levels: circulating protein (OR = 0.912, 95 % CI = 0.882–0.942), blood-derived gene expression (OR = 0.772, 95 % CI = 0.598–0.997), and cerebral cortex expression (OR = 0.573, 95 % CI = 0.455–0.721). Causality was further supported by SMR (pSMR = 5.38E-04; pHEIDI = 0.478) and Bayesian colocalization (PP.H₄ = 0.915). The protective effect of FCRL3 on MS was found to be partially mediated by CD3 expression on naïve CD4+ T cells.
Conclusion
This study systematically evaluated the causal roles of immune-related genes in MS susceptibility and identified FCRL3 as a protective factor. These findings underscore the significance of FCRL3 in MS pathogenesis and suggest its potential as a target for future immunotherapeutic strategies.}

This study endeavors to define transformative resilience through data-driven insights and explores trends in related research by mapping its topics and fields. We employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, which extracts key terms and insights into topics from a large volume of literature. We traced the evolution of research topics from 1951 to 2024 based on connections between citations. The data were sourced from the Scopus database using the query term “transformative resilience”, encompassing titles, abstracts, and keywords of journal articles, book chapters, and conference papers. We collected a total of 3110 related pieces of literature. We defined transformative resilience as a change of system structure accompanied by a shift in socio-political values and policy. The results of LDA showed that transformative resilience research has developed into seven fields: Innovation and Economic Policy, Supply Chain and Technological Response, Health and Social Well-being, Agriculture and Environmental Impact, Community Resilience and Disaster Recovery, Sustainability Theory and Practice, and Urban Governance and Planning. Based on topic evolution relationships, topics anchored in a context perspective have grown increasingly specialized and productive, while those rooted in a theory perspective have stagnated or remained underexplored. Our findings suggest that transformative resilience studies should foster greater interdisciplinary connections to effectively integrate current research, merging mechanization-centered approaches with a focus on building context-centered resilience.}

Estimated using general spatial model (GSM), the results reveal negative effects of social capital on carbon emissions. Furthermore, the estimated carbon emissions are lower when considering the spatiotemporal effects of carbon emissions.

ITCNOD showed a selective “turn-on” fluorescence response to Ag⁺ ions at 304 nm in DMSO/H₂O (1:1, v/v) with 50 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.0. Among several metal ions, only Ag⁺ caused significant fluorescence enhancement with minimal interference. Job’s plot, fluorescence titration, and Benesi–Hildebrand analysis confirmed a 1:1 binding stoichiometry, a high association constant (Ka= 9.69 × 10⁵ M⁻¹), and a low detection limit (1.68 × 10⁻⁸ M) for Ag⁺. The ITCNOD–Ag⁺ complex further enabled selective fluorescence quenching by tryptophan (Trp) among amino acids, with a LOD of 6.9 × 10⁻⁷ M and Ka = 3.5 × 10⁵ M⁻¹, indicating dual-analyte detection. Time-resolved and pH studies revealed optimal and reversible sensing between pH 7.0–8.0. The fluorescence enhancement is attributed to PET inhibition and ICT enhancement upon Ag⁺ binding, while Trp induces quenching through competitive coordination. This reversible “OFF–ON–OFF” fluorescence switching facilitated the development of an INHIBIT molecular logic gate, demonstrated through fluorescence logic circuits and EDTA/Trp cycling studies. ITCNOD’s practical utility was validated through Ag⁺ detection in real samples (water, soil, food, pharmaceuticals), with recovery rates of 94.1–102.1 % and strong correlation to ICP-OES (R² > 0.99). Additionally, paper strip-based testing and Escherichia coli fluorescence microscopy demonstrated the chemosensor’s potential for field-level diagnostics and bioimaging. The ITCNOD–Ag⁺ complex also showed visible colour change and in situ cellular fluorescence, confirming its dual-mode sensing capability.}

Our study used a regression discontinuity design (RDD) with a unique dataset (N = 2545) from two major Chinese cities, Beijing and Shanghai, to examine the effects of the COVID containment policy shift on mental wellbeing and green space exposure. We compared participants by different green exposure categories to investigate variations in mental wellbeing during this transitional phase. The findings confirm that the policy does not promote short-term mental wellbeing, as measured by CES-D scores, self-rated health, happiness, and frequency of negative feelings. Residing 400–1200 m from a park, but not extremely close (within 400 m), confers mental health benefits. Visual exposure to greenery from windows bolsters mental wellbeing compared to limited greenery views, although the magnitude of this effect is modest. This study underscores the importance of urban green spaces in buffering mental wellbeing impacts of major policy changes during pandemic, highlighting their importance in urban planning and public health strategies.}

In this paper, a multi-objective FJSP model considering limited transportation and auxiliary resources is proposed in the context of hydraulic cylinder manufacturing, aiming to minimize the maximum completion time and semi-finished product inventory cost. To address the problem, a reinforcement learning enhanced imperialist competitive algorithm (RLICA) is proposed. The algorithm has the following features: multiple hybrid initialization strategies are introduced to enhance population diversity and quality. Additionally, a dynamic parameter adaptation strategy based on reinforcement learning is designed for the assimilation stage to optimize the exploration–exploitation balance during the colonization assimilation process. Finally, a two-layer neighborhood search operator is implemented to improve the algorithm’s local search capability. The experimental section evaluates the performance of the algorithm based on 33 benchmark instances and real enterprise data. The results demonstrate that RLICA significantly outperforms five other state-of-the-art algorithms regarding convergence, distribution, and robustness. Case study further demonstrates that the algorithm can effectively coordinate transportation, processing, and auxiliary resource systems, offering a robust scheduling optimization solution for complex manufacturing scenarios.}

abstract = {Introduction
Dysfunction in amygdala networks has been implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD). Pharmacological treatments, such as esketamine and sertraline, are believed to exert their antidepressant effects by modulating amygdalar activity. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between changes in dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) within amygdala subregions and treatment outcomes, with a focus on identifying potential neuroimaging markers.
Methods
Twenty-eight patients with MDD received six intravenous infusions of esketamine (0.25 mg/kg) combined with 2 weeks of sertraline treatment. Mood and cognitive recovery were assessed using the HAMA, HAMD, BSI, and MoCA. Seed-based dFC analysis of resting-state MRI focused on the dorsal amygdala (DA), medial amygdala (MA), and ventrolateral amygdala (VA).
Results
All patients demonstrated positive responses to treatment, with significant reductions in HAMA and HAMD scores, as well as improvements in MoCA scores and a decrease in suicidal ideation. Following treatment, static functional connectivity (sFC) was reduced between the right DA and paracentral lobule, the left VA and multiple regions (including the lentiform nucleus, thalamus, medial prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, precentral gyrus, and superior parietal lobule), and the right VA and middle frontal gyrus. Conversely, dFC was significantly increased between the right DA and cuneus/superior parietal lobule, and between the left VA and superior parietal lobule. A decrease in dFC was also observed between the left MA and superior temporal gyrus. Correlation analysis showed that dFC between the left MA and superior temporal gyrus was positively correlated with HAMA score.
Limitation
The combined use of esketamine and sertraline limits the ability to differentiate their individual effects. A significant proportion of the patients were adolescents, with only a few adults, which may influence the age-related response to treatment. The study utilized the lowest effective dose of esketamine, thereby leaving the dose-response relationships unexamined. The small sample size further restricts the statistical power of the findings, highlighting the need for larger studies to validate these results.
Conclusion
Altered resting-state and dFC in amygdala subregions may play a role in the mechanisms by which the combination of esketamine and sertraline alleviates depressive symptoms, primarily involving the sensorimotor and default mode networks. Together, the sFC and dFC analyses provide an integrated perspective on depression-related connectivity changes and offer potential targets for treatment.}

The ratio of chemical bioexergy to calorific value ranges from 1.013 to 1.078, indicating that calorific value alone underestimates the usable energy content by 1.3–7.8 %. Biomass fuels present unique challenges due to heterogeneous composition and complex conversion pathways, requiring precise data and thermodynamic understanding.

To enhance oxygen utilization, the dead-end cathode mode (DEC) is employed and investigated under various purge operations at operating load levels in this study. Oxygen utilization is experimentally determined and used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) model via the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm at purge durations of 100, 500, and 900 ms. The ANN model is applied to predict oxygen utilization at purge durations of 300 and 700 ms, which are validated against experimental data. Furthermore, oxygen utilization is predicted at new purge durations of 200, 400, 600, and 800 ms. The model performance is evaluated and demonstrates a high correlation coefficient (R2), low mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The results indicate that, at the optimal purge duration of 100 ms and purge intervals of 35, 110, and 300 s, the maximum oxygen utilization of 9.4, 11.2, and 13.0 kJ L−1 is achieved under varying load levels of 0.8, 0.4, and 0.1 A cm−2, respectively.

Thus, the fabricated PEC aptasensor based on Bi/Bi2MoO6@PCN heterojunction exhibited outstanding selectivity and stability for TC detection, which displayed a wider linear range of 0.05–350 nM and a lower detection limit of 0.036 nM. In addition, the proposed aptasensor showed the acceptable recoveries (98.41–104.76 %) for TC residue analysis in animal-derived food, including milk, honey and pork.

This sociotechnical enterprise-wide endeavor incorporates the leadership commitment, strategic and financial planning, strategic resource allocation, change management, procurement, and technology adoption and implementation that evolves over time. Managing the envisioning and planning phase involves assessing DHM as a strategic requirement for establishing realistic goals by (1) determining current maturity, (2) identifying the gaps and opportunities, and, accordingly, (3) prioritizing investment, funding, and resource allocations to facilitate optimal conditions for the digital health program to thrive. During the implementation and operations phase, DHM remains a guiding principle for (1) managing the overall performance of a digital health program in alignment with the organization's strategic priorities, (2) change management processes, and (3) evaluating the impacts of implemented changes to the organization's digital health maturity. The DHM can guide a systematic approach to uncover new ways to scale-up program impact for the end users and health ecosystem partners.}

Using the panel data analysis of 9091 government documents from 2007 to 2022, we systematically examine the diffusion mechanisms of China's low-carbon policies. Our findings reveal that learning, imitation, and coercion are the primary mechanisms driving the intensity of low-carbon policy diffusion, while economic competition plays an insignificant role. Furthermore, urban carbon emission levels and public environmental awareness promote policy diffusion, whereas energy consumption dependency inhibits it. By demonstrating an effective application of text mining techniques in measuring policy diffusion intensity, this study provides new methodological and empirical insights for understanding policy diffusion within multi-level governance systems.}

Additionally, museums and historic buildings in urban areas can serve as venues for the conservation and display of ex situ exhibits. However, despite these advantages, geoheritage in urban areas remains vulnerable due to insufficient consideration of the abiotic values of the territory and the impacts of human interaction, which can lead to damage or loss of geoheritage. Disseminating knowledge about urban geoheritage is a crucial initial step in raising awareness among citizens, tourists and public administrations about these often-overlooked resources, which are vital for the sustainable growth of cities.

We consider the possibility that relational concepts can also be represented unitarily, whereby the concept is a property of the stimulus as a whole. The distinction between compositional and unitary representations of relational concepts is a natural consequence of structure-mapping theory, but its psychological implications have not been explored. We report three experiments in which we examine how encouraging subjects to represent relational concepts compositionally versus unitarily affects learning on classification- and inference-based category learning tasks. Our findings showed that encouraging unitary representations led to better learning than encouraging compositional representations, especially for inference-based learning. We conclude that unitary representations incur less cognitive load than structural alignment of compositional representations, and thus may be the default for everyday relational learning and reasoning.}

Nevertheless, organized philosophies should be utilized to process biosignal data in the investigation routine and decipher the intricacy of the biosignals. The proposed work strives to bridge the gap between biosignal acquisition and several useful outputs using wearable sensors, ML algorithms, and signal processing techniques.

The proposed work is a multimodal approach for analysis and interpretation of biosignals based on the blend of techniques of ML and signal processing. First, selected biosignals will undergo a detailed preprocessing step to minimize noise, artifacts, and fluctuation of the baseline to maintain data fidelity, providing a methodology that propels individual, professional, and healthcare systems alike into an era of personalized, data-driven healthcare delivery. Extraction of information from biosignal data will subsequently be carried out with feature extraction algorithms, simplifying the characterization of physiological processes. The biosignal data will then be analyzed using ML algorithms to discover intricate patterns and relationships among them, thus enabling tasks such as anomaly detection, classification, and grouping. Unsupervised learning methodologies are used to reveal patterns and structures that would otherwise remain hidden to the eye, and the supervised learning approach will help to build predictive models for diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. Essentially, the work that is being suggested represents the coming together of state-of-the-art computational techniques with the demands of contemporary health care, signaling the beginning of a revolutionary period in biosignal analysis and its social ramifications.

As a renewable energy carrier, hydrogen holds significant promise as an alternative to traditional energy sources due to its high energy density, abundant availability, and zero-emission combustion. However, challenges such as high cost and low efficiency in hydrogen production, storage, transportation, and application contribute to its relatively low overall energy conversion efficiency. Therefore, establishing a comprehensive industrial system is crucial to advance the utilization of hydrogen energy. This review proposes an integrated industrial framework that includes offshore wind power and seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production, purification, storage, transportation, and application in fuel cells, offering a novel strategy for the development of the hydrogen energy industry. Additionally, we summarize advances in hydrogen storage alloys (HSAs), which can directly absorb hydrogen produced from seawater electrolysis and supply it at the required pressure for fuel cell applications. Based on their performance, we identify suitable HSAs from the existing studies that meet these criteria. These selected HSAs are integrated with hydrogen storage tanks and marine transportation to establish a completely coupled engineering system. This review offers insights into the future developmental potential of this system and its prospects for large-scale practical applications.}

abstract = {Agricultural systems are increasingly vulnerable to biological invasions and climate extremes, particularly drought, which can disrupt competitive balances and favor invasive weed establishment. Ecological strategies such as integrating temporary grassland phases into crop rotations offer potential to enhance system resilience, yet their long-term effectiveness under drought stress remains poorly quantified. A 12-year field experiment in western France was used to evaluated five rotational systems differing in the duration (3 or 6 years) and nitrogen fertilization of grassland phases within annual crop rotations. Weed invasion patterns were assessed using hierarchical statistical models, and an integrative drought stress index was developed to capture both the intensity and duration of water deficits over time. The influence of grassland management on invasive weed richness, temporal dynamics, drought sensitivity, and weed carryover between phases was examined. Invasive weed richness increased linearly with the proportion of annual crops, while systems with prolonged, well-fertilized grasslands exhibited significantly reduced invasion pressure—even under drought. Grassland phases buffered the effects of climate stress and minimized weed persistence across years, particularly when nitrogen inputs were adequate. Conceptualizing the system as a dynamic source–sink model revealed that crops serve as invasion sources, while well-managed grasslands act as ecological sinks that suppress invaders over time. These findings highlight the value of spatial–temporal diversification as a nature-based solution to reduce weed invasion in a changing climate. Incorporating extended grassland phases into rotations can strengthen agroecosystem resistance to invasive species and reduce dependency on chemical control strategies, contributing to the design of more sustainable and climate-resilient agricultural landscapes.}

abstract = {Treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently considered highly challenging among various neurodegenerative diseases. The precision of AD diagnosis can be confounded by multiple factors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical tool for diagnosing AD. To assist physicians in clinical diagnosis, a new hybrid model, CTM-Net, is proposed based on MRI. CTM-Net incorporates a CNN enhanced by a channel attention mechanism to extract local fine-grained features from MRI slices, which are then mapped into high-level representations. Subsequently, the model integrates a Transformer's multi-head attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies across MRI slices. The local continuity of features between two adjacent MRI slices is enhanced using a one-dimensional convolution operation, which gradually fuse spatially adjacent features to ultimately obtain global MRI information. CTM-Net was validated on the ADNI dataset. It achieved 92.70%, 83.00%, and 79.07% accuracy on the three classification tasks of AD vs. CN, AD vs. MCI, and MCI vs. CN, respectively. Compared to other models applied to AD classification tasks, the proposed model yielded superior results in terms of accuracy. CTM-Net is a Convolution-Transformer hybrid model for AD classification and diagnosis tasks, which can combine the advantages of the CNN and attention mechanism to make the most of interactive information between local lesion features and global context features for improving diagnosis efficiency.}

This study presents an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)-based biosensor for the sensitive and selective detection of HPV-16 mutant DNA. A single-stranded DNA probe complementary to the target sequence was immobilized on a gold interdigitated electrode (G-IDE) modified with lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ (LSCF) nanopowder to enhance charge transfer. The synthesized LSCF, composed of ∼32 nm discrete cubic particles, was characterized by electron microscopy, XRD, and SAED, confirming its crystalline structure. FTIR indicated metal-oxygen bonding, while Raman spectroscopy revealed oxygen and carbon non-stoichiometry in the perovskite. The developed sensor achieved a limit of detection of 0.0213 fM, with a tested detection range from 1 fM to 1 nM and a linear dynamic range from 1 fM to 100 pM (R2 = 0.9983). Selectivity was confirmed using mismatch and non-complementary strands, which produced negligible impedance changes. These results demonstrate the potential of the LSCF-G-IDE biosensor as a promising platform for future point-of-care HPV diagnostics.}

The development of organic synthesis in water is of paramount importance from both the economic and environmental points of view. To that end, the solubility issue of most organic reagents and the catalytic performance issue of molecular catalysts need to be tackled. Inspired by enzymes, the immobilization of molecular catalysts into organic colloids provides access to the implementation of organic catalytic synthesis in water. Furthermore, the hydrophobic interaction-assisted immobilization of molecular catalysts creates hydrophobic microenvironments, provides pseudo-solvent effects, and enables the compartmentalization of incompatible catalysts. In this review, we review the recent advances in the hydrophobic interaction-assisted immobilization of molecular catalysts into organic colloids. Three types of techniques, including self-assembly of amphiphiles, mixing-induced nanoprecipitation, and miniemulsion polymerization, have been recently utilized for the construction of these catalysts. Their preparation, characterization, and applications are summarized and discussed. The design principles, positive effects, and structure-activity relationships of these organic colloids will stimulate the development of more sustainable chemical processes and more efficient enzyme mimics.}

abstract = {CONTEXT
Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) offers considerable potential to reduce water use and methane emissions in irrigated rice systems without compromising yields. However, despite decades of promotion, AWD adoption remains limited, especially in gravity-fed irrigation systems where institutional and agro-environmental complexities pose challenges to implementation.
OBJECTIVE
This study assessed the biophysical, socio-economic, and institutional determinants of AWD adoption at the turnout level in a gravity-fed irrigation system in Nueva Ecija, Philippines. The aim was to identify key barriers and opportunities for scaling AWD under spatially heterogeneous and rotationally scheduled irrigation conditions.
METHODS
Six turnouts within the Lateral G canal of the Upper Pampanga River Integrated Irrigation System were selected. Data were collected on plot elevation, soil texture, ownership patterns, water application, and grain yield. Water governance structures were analysed through focus group discussions and interviews with stakeholders. A decision logic framework was used to classify AWD adoption based on field-level water depth measurements.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
AWD reduced irrigation input by 21 % in the dry season and 50 % in the wet season while maintaining yields. However, adoption was constrained by elevation-driven water flow patterns, clay distribution, tenant-operated plots, and rigid rotational schedules. AWD adoption was more feasible during the wet season due to reduced irrigation risk. Weak farmer engagement in decision-making limited field-level adaptability.
SIGNIFICANCE
Scaling AWD requires reconfigured irrigation governance, integration of real-time water monitoring technologies, and economic incentives such as carbon financing. Context-specific, multi-level interventions are essential to enable large-scale AWD implementation in gravity-fed systems.}

abstract = {The Metal-Support Interactions (MSI) effect has been widely proposed and applied in catalyst design, playing a pivotal role in catalytic mechanism research and performance enhancement. However, in catalyst research as a branch of surface science, surface elemental distribution is often overlooked. This study systematically reveals the intrinsic relationship between ionic radius and surface elemental distribution in catalysts by synthesizing a series of Cu-Zn/MO catalysts. XPS, H2-TPR, and catalyst evaluation results show that the interaction between Cu and La2O3 is stronger. This characteristic leads Cu-Zn/La2O3 to exhibit the highest methanol yield per gram of surface copper (13.44 gMeOH/gCu/h), which is higher than Cu-Zn/Al2O3 (11.20 gMeOH/gCu/h). Further investigation demonstrates that due to the radius of Al3+ (0.53 Å) is smaller than that of Cu2+ (0.72 Å) and Zn2+ (0.74 Å); and the radius of Ce4+ (0.92 Å) and La3+ (1.03 Å) are larger than those of Cu2+ and Zn2+. Consequently, when Cu is loaded onto La2O3 and CeO2 supports, the active Cu component incorporates into the support lattice, resulting in fewer active components on the surface. In contrast, when Cu is deposited on Al2O3, the active Cu component remains well-dispersed on the catalyst surface. Furthermore, Cu-Zn/Al2O3 exhibited the lowest activation energy (22.85 kJ/mol). This study provides a new perspective for the traditional approach of solely focusing on MSI in catalyst design, emphasizing the importance of regulating surface elemental distribution.}

Moreover, we argue that this relationship will be more pronounced when there is lower opportunity for interpersonal knowledge transfer, and in particular when firms (a) have a large number of employees, (b) do not provide on-site employee training, and (c) have higher employee turnover. We use a unique combination of survey and social balance sheet data on a sample of 2268 Belgian firms. Heckman maximum-likelihood probit models and several robustness tests confirm the majority of our hypotheses. The study enriches the literature on process innovation and knowledge management, and provides important theoretical and practical insights on how and under which circumstances AI can lead to a competitive advantage.}

High amylose maize starch (HAMS) exhibits exceptional gel-forming capability due to its unique amylose-to-amylopectin ratio, rendering it a promising material for emulsion gels. However, its strong hydrophilicity and dense granular structure restrict interfacial adsorption, limiting practical applications. Herein, an innovative emulsion gel system based solely on HAMS was developed by integrating octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) modification with microwave treatment-assisted gelatinization, enabling efficient energy utilization, green clean-label production, and simplified processing. The effects of starch concentration (c = 2–8 %) and oil fraction (Φ = 30–60 %) on gel properties were systematically investigated to reveal the formation mechanism. Increasing the starch concentration or oil fraction improved droplet uniformity, self-supporting ability, gel strength, and water holding capacity. Furthermore, Cryo-SEM analysis revealed sufficient starch addition played a more critical role in stable gel network formation, which formed ''sheet-like'' networks, whereas oil droplets acted as active fillers and reinforced the gel matrix through interfacial starch-starch interactions. The stability analyzer indicated that higher starch concentrations and oil fractions synergistically enhanced the storage stability of emulsion gels. This study provides a green, clean-label strategy for HAMS utilization in emulsion gels, alongside insights into structure-function relationships and potential applications in fat replacement and bioactive delivery.}

However, in power grids with IBRs, protection systems face challenges due to the behavior of voltages and currents. While phasor-based fault location is widely used, it is significantly impacted by fault resistance. Thus, the present article proposes an approach that combines apparent impedance techniques with machine learning (ML), using data exclusively from the substation, to accurately estimate fault locations in IBRs interconnection lines. Initially, a ML-based approach estimates the fault resistance and applies a compensation factor to estimate the fault current. The approach proved promising, reducing average errors in the fault location task to less than 1% without requiring new meters in the system, communication structures between transmission line terminals, or meters with higher sampling frequencies.}

By synchronizing real-time data with simulation models, digital twins support enhanced situational awareness, scenario testing, and performance optimization. However, implementing digital twins involves a complex process that introduces multidimensional risks, many of which are poorly understood. This study addresses the gap by identifying and analyzing key risk factors associated with digital twin adoption. A hybrid approach combines a systematic literature review, expert validation from 19 professionals, and fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory analysis to map and prioritize 15 critical risks across four categories: Technological, Governance/Ethical, Social, and Economic. Results indicate that economic challenges are central drivers, while data privacy and security, computational resource limitations, lack of transparency, job displacement, and high implementation costs represent significant secondary risks. Expert consultations identified practical strategies to reduce the top risks, including strong data governance, gradual (iterative) technology rollout, continuous performance monitoring, and designing systems with users in mind. These strategies directly address the most critical risks highlighted in the analysis. The structured risk framework provides actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners, supporting informed decision-making and robust risk management strategies. These findings enhance understanding of potential barriers and contribute to more sustainable and responsible deployment of digital twin technology in infrastructure and beyond.}

The intrusion and lifting processes were simulated using the EDEM discrete element method to analyze the micro-scale characteristics of the velocity fields and particle movement patterns in water-saturated soils under varying intrusion and lifting angles. At a constant soil moisture level, both intrusion resistance and lifting resistance decreased gradually with an increase in the intrusion angle of the solid. Regarding the influence of soil moisture content, the intrusion resistance of the solid exhibited a pattern of initial decrease, followed by an increase, and a final decrease. The primary and secondary influencing factors were determined through a two-factor analysis. Discrete element simulation results indicate that the solid’s impact on soil particles primarily forms a conical shear zone, with the disturbance range of the soil particles decreasing as the solid’s angle increases. Based on the intrusion tests and simulation results, a pressure-bearing mechanical model incorporating the solid's intrusion angle was developed. Correlation coefficients for farmland soils with varying moisture contents are provided, offering a new design reference and theoretical basis for advancing traveling device technology in wet and soft terrains, as well as for predicting solid performance.}

We analyse three different case studies that offer alternative models of entrepreneurial approaches for achieving sustainability outcomes as a higher priority than economic growth. We identified three post-growth food enterprises that operate at different stages of the food supply chain. We found that these enterprises work towards various, interconnected, sustainability goals by embedding diverse principles into their organisational structure and operations. Their not-for-profit structure enables them to avoid trade-offs between financial extractivism and socio-ecological well-being goals. Additionally, we explored the systemic barriers faced by these enterprises, recognising that they are embedded in an economic system that favours and rewards the pursuit of economic growth. To navigate these barriers, the cases analysed adopted various innovative approaches, such as fostering alternative funding schemes, ways to acquire farmland and technology. While their bottom-up approaches are important, the inertia of dominant food systems impedes transitions to alternatives. We suggest that exnovation – the process of deliberately phasing out unsustainable practices – warrants more attention. For example, exnovating goals, policies, and performance metrics that prioritise economic growth at the expense of sustainability could play a crucial role in unlocking post-growth models. This study provides an orientation for further theoretical and empirical research about post-growth food systems transitions and stresses the value of engaging more with the wider political, economic, and legal foundations of transitions.}

abstract = {Rockburst is a severe geological disaster that poses significant challenges to underground rock engineering. In this study, true triaxial loading tests were conducted on cubic sandstone samples with a hole under four different hole size conditions to investigate the influence of tunnel size effects on rockburst evolution and fracture behaviors. Through electric potential (EP) technology and particle flow numerical simulations, the failure evolution of tunnel sidewalls and rockburst modes of samples were revealed. The influence of tunnel sizes on rockburst mechanisms and EP generation were further examined by analyzing the multiple-scale fracture features and electrical parameters. Results show that an increase in hole diameters alters the stress concentration distribution and crack propagation modes, leading to larger deformation, smaller rockburst strength, and broader affected regions. Rockburst-induced fracturing leads to microstructure changes, resulting in charge accumulation and significant alterations in the electric field, which in turn trigger anomalous response features detected by EP technology. The EP imaging sensitively captures damage features of rockburst, aligning well with stress field evolution. Moreover, the intensity and abruptness of EPs become more pronounced with increasing hole diameters. Three mechanisms are proposed to explain these observations. (i) The load-bearing capacity of rock mass weakens, which promotes rockburst initiation while suppressing rockburst strength. (ii) The local stress concentrations and initial fracture locations are altered due to changes in crack propagation paths, affecting both the extent and severity of rockburst. (iii) The lower stress concentration and slower energy release occur, resulting in a more complex crack network. Based on well agreement between experimental observations and numerical simulations, the study summarizes three distinct rockburst failure modes under the effect of tunnel diameters. These findings enhance our understanding of rockburst disasters in real tunnel environments and provide potential engineering measures for rockburst prevention.}

abstract = {Surgical robots are one of the biggest medical shifts in the contemporary world, providing precision, dexterity levels, and minimally invasive surgery. Thus, the description of the kinematics as well as the dynamics of these robots would enhance the understanding of the robots in achieving safe and accurate operations within the surgical procedures. In this chapter, a comprehensible review and analysis of the principles of kinematic and dynamic models in surgical robots have been undertaken alongside the display of their importance, difficulty, and expectation in the feature. Surgical robots—like the Da Vinci surgical system—are increasingly being used in one surgical specialty or another because of their variable benefits in that they can improve the precision of surgical operations. Nevertheless, to ensure their efficiency, their kinematics and dynamics must be modeled correctly. This chapter provides an overview of kinematics and dynamics concepts to be used in advanced surgical robot designs. It encompasses as far as forward and inverse kinematics, movement dynamics, and control methodologies. Examples have been used from the real world to support the learning objectives of these concepts. The enhanced functionality of surgeries means that such procedures require profound control of the robotic manipulators to perform their functions; therefore, specific knowledge about their kinematic designs and dynamic patterns is essential. Some of the issues like the size of the workspace, the constraints between the links, and the timing requirements are rather daunting to deal with when it comes to achieving high performance. The primary goal of this chapter is therefore to review the principles of kinematics and dynamics in surgical robotics and present the readers with the background knowledge as well as pointers regarding their application. It looks at areas of concern and control methods to stimulate the furthering of innovation and development. An important understanding of these kinematic and dynamic models is presented in this chapter, which unveils the dynamics of interaction between a robotic manipulator and a surgical workspace. Furthermore, it surfaces the tools of impedance control and haptic feedback that hold prominence in making surgical apparitions and augment the surgeon’s ability. In summary, this reflection highlights the need for practical-oriented application of surgical robots where theory is integrated with base practical approaches to improve the effectiveness of current healthcare systems.}

The empirical results show that removing fuel subsidies affects overall household consumption, GDP, and oil prices in both the short and long run of these countries. Thus, abolishing fuel subsidies in ASEAN countries may significantly alter citizens' living standards. Hence, the policy recommendations for ASEAN countries include adopting a non-price energy policy in the energy sector, such as autonomous energy efficiency improvement and green energy technologies. Doing so will promote the development of a clean and diversified energy economy and maintain the growth trajectories of ASEAN countries.}

Treatment options include radiation or surgical intervention, according to the tumor location, morphology, and stage, as well as the patient's overall health and ocular criteria. Surgical interventions, such as localized tumor resection and removal, aim to eradicate cancerous tissue while optimizing the maintenance of visual function. Conservative surgical techniques have advanced recently to improve medical results, making it possible to do deeper resections. A non-invasive technique called radiotherapy, which includes proton beam treatment and plaque brachytherapy, delivers strong doses of radiation straight to the tumor surface while sparing tissue that is healthy nearby. These radiotherapeutic techniques have shown efficacy in localized tumor control and have become the primary treatment for numerous tiny to large melanomas. All treatment approaches, however, include potential complications including radiation retinal degeneration, cataract formation, and secondary vision impairment. This chapter reviews the effectiveness, applications, and outcomes of surgery and radiotherapeutic procedures for ocular melanoma, emphasizing the need of individualized treatment options to enhance local tumor control.}

These conditions can lead to severe complications, including damage to organs such as the heart and kidneys while also increasing susceptibility to infectious illnesses like coronavirus disease-2019. Noncommunicable diseases account for 74% of worldwide deaths, with 77% occurring in low as well as moderate-income countries. The economic burden of chronic diseases is also substantial, contributing to $3.8 trillion in healthcare costs yearly in the United States. The personal toll of chronic illness is significant, affecting patients’ autonomy, identity, and mental well-being, as long-term management often leads to lifestyle changes and stress. Despite the importance of primary care, most health systems remain focused on acute, episodic care, lacking the infrastructure for sustained, coordinated management. This highlights the need for healthcare policies to prioritize long-term, proactive care. Prevention, early diagnosis, and lifestyle changes are essential in reducing the impact of chronic diseases. Advances in precision medicine, polygenic risk prediction, and digital health technologies offer the potential for better detection and management, though their collective impact at the population level requires further study. In low-resource settings, the challenge of managing both chronic and communicable diseases is even more pressing. Limitations of this chapter include evolving definitions of chronic illness and the lack of comprehensive data on integrated prevention and management strategies, especially in low-income regions, underscoring the need for further research.}

This dynamic creates an environment where misinformation can thrive, exploiting these biases to spread rapidly. This chapter reviews evidence illustrating the interplay between human tendencies and algorithmic design, arguing that this interaction plays a critical role in the dissemination of misinformation. By addressing both human behavior and algorithmic structures, we can effectively combat misinformation problems. It outlines several promising directions for research into the psychological factors underlying misinformation sharing within the framework of human–algorithm interaction.}

Due to prolonged neglect in maintenance and management, these communities are susceptible to external stigmatization. However, existing research rarely examines the effect of stigma on housing prices in such neighborhoods. To address this gap, this study explores the influence of stigmatization on housing prices in old urban communities, with a particular emphasis on the mediating role of the neighborhood environment. Utilizing street view image data and deep learning methods, this study constructs six indicators of the neighborhood environment: greenness, openness, walkability, imaginability, enclosure, and complexity. Based on these indicators, a hedonic pricing model and a mediation effect model are developed to empirically examine the complex relationships among old communities, neighborhood environment, and housing prices. To address the potential limitations of linear models, a robustness check was conducted by using a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) model combined with SHAP analysis. The results indicate that a significant stigma effect exists in old communities, leading to an overall decline in housing prices by 11 %. Further analysis reveals that this stigma effect can be categorized into a direct effect of psychological labeling (−9.6 %) and an indirect effect mediated by environmental factors (−1.4 %). The non-linear model produced highly consistent results, with the indirect effect mediated by the neighborhood environment accounting for 16.7 % of the total effect. These findings highlight the dominant role of social perception over physical conditions in shaping housing prices. The study offers empirical support for stigma theory in urban housing markets and provides practical implications for neighborhood regeneration strategies.}

abstract = {Ocular melanoma, also known as uveal melanoma, is a rare but potentially deadly cancer that develops in the eye's melanocytes, which are pigment-producing cells. It ranks as the most widespread form of melanoma following skin melanoma in terms of occurrence. Although it can happen at any age, it usually appears initially between the ages of 50 and 70. Men are slightly more likely than women to be affected, and there has become a slight male dominance. In the US and Europe, the occurrence rate is roughly five to six cases per million individuals annually. On a global scale, the frequency varies, with Asian as well as African populations experiencing lower prevalence. Approximately 85%–90% of ocular tumors develop in the uveal tract, specifically in the choroid, which is the blood vessels layer underneath the retina. The ciliary organ or iris may be the site of the remaining infections. Conjunctival melanomas are particularly less common and possess an altered likelihood and epidemiological study. This chapter explores the epidemiology and causes of melanoma while discussing its diagnosis and treatment to underscore its importance in public health awareness. It discusses the population demographics by shedding light on the vulnerability of individuals with fair skin and light-colored eyes and the differing occurrence rates, across various regions. Various factors contribute to risks such as genetic inclinations and effects of light iris colors. Determining at-risk populations and improving early detection techniques require an understanding of the epidemiology of ocular melanoma. Treatment options are significantly impacted by this knowledge because it empowers medical professionals to create tailored interventions based on particular risk factors. The progress in methods that aid in detection such as imaging techniques and genetic tests that play a vital role in enhancing patient results has been discussed. It also covers treatment choices including localized therapies, radiation, and surgical procedures as upcoming targeted therapies showing potential in treating advanced stages of the disease. This chapter seeks to enhance our knowledge of melanoma by combining research and clinical discoveries to benefit healthcare experts and researchers working in this area.}

The results reveal that: 1) The dominant urban expansion patterns in Chinese cities are shifting, leading to a more compact urban form. 2) During the study periods, QoUE values ranged from (0, 59.00] and (0, 61.18], respectively. The high-high clusters of QoUE are mainly in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration and Upper Yangtze River region. The low-low units are in Shandong and Xinjiang, respectively. The spatial clustering of infilling and edge-expansion quality enhances. And the values of the indicators on infilling and edge expansion patches are higher. 3) The tertiary industry as percentage to GDP (TIP) positively affects QoUE at a global scale, and the other factors affect QoUE at varying scales and directions. The results offer policy implications for sustainable land use and high-quality urban development. Moreover, the concept of urban expansion evaluation can be adapted and extended for broader applications.}

While it is important to apprehend how people recover from these disasters, little is known about the role of saving in the process of disaster recovery. This paper empirically investigates dynamics in the saving behavior induced by storm events. Using an event study design and merging data from the Penn World Table with the EM-DAT database for 176 countries in a 69-year long period, we find a decrease in annual private saving rates by 1.85 and 2.29 percentage points four and five years following storms, respectively. Further results indicate that storms slow down per capita labor income growth by about 3 percentage points in the first two post-storm years. For intensely damaging storms, it follows a fall in saving rates by 3.19, 4.98, and 4.59 percentage points in the third, fourth, and fifth post-storm year, respectively. Declining international aid, financial access, coverage of social protection and labor programs, and rule of law within the first three post-storm years precede the falling saving rates. Robustness checks using the ifo GAME database reveal that the propensity to dis-save following the strike of a storm is instantaneous in developing countries, while it is delayed by up to three years in developed countries where people have a buffer against intense storms.}

However, effective communication of such policies is crucial to generate support and preserve guest satisfaction. Grounded in sound symbolism, this study examines how the pitch of a video voiceover influences the identifiable victim effect, ultimately shaping tourists' support for pro-environmental practices in hotels. Two experimental studies consistently demonstrate that a higher-pitch (vs. lower-pitch) voice leads participants to perceive the speaker as younger while simultaneously heightening their sense of victimization by environmental degradation. This voice-induced perception serves as a salient verbal cue that activates the identifiable victim effect through moral emotions. These findings extend our understanding of how voice pitch modulates both biological (age) and psychological (victimization) perceptions in video-based environmental communication. Practically, this study puts forward a way that tourism businesses can immediately and easily enhance the effectiveness of their pro-environmental messaging by adjusting the voice pitch.}

However, the wave velocity often shows clear stress-induced “anisotropy” in the presence of non-hydrostatic stress field. A correction method to assess the degree of jointing considering P-wave velocity and the in-situ stress conditions is presented in this study. The theoretical relationship between P-wave velocity and stress anisotropy is proposed for porous rocks in principal stress space based on experimental evidence. The P-wave velocity in arbitrary direction under three-dimensional stress conditions is approximated based on a velocity-ellipsoid model. Thus, the degree of jointing or the rock mass integrity can be evaluated by comparing field-measured wave velocity of rock masses with that of laboratory-tested rock cores under uniaxial stress conditions, with the inclusion of a stress-dependent velocity correction. Based on the in-situ stress and wave velocity testing data from a traffic tunnel at the Jinping-II hydropower station, this proposed method for evaluating the degree of jointing is validated. Correlating the wave velocity of intact rock cores with in-situ stress conditions prevents anomalies where the ratio of the velocity of rock masses to that of rock cores exceeds 1. Some rock masses originally classified as Grade I were downgraded, necessitating different support measures.}

abstract = {This chapter aims to present essential insights into the use of computer technology and the construction of mathematical models for the development of healthcare engineering with focus on early disease diagnosis, medication control, and medical image processing. Recent developments and possible future directions of biomedical models are discussed based on differential equations, statistics, machine learning, and network science. Such models are important to represent the dispersion of medication, refine cancer therapies, and enhance the quality of images used in diagnosing patients. Drug–protein interactions, a method that belongs to network science, help to predict targets of the drugs, their metabolisms, and subsequent doses and toxicity levels. However, the chapter also includes different types of problems and issues, including the issue of data quality and volume, the privacy and protection of patients data, computational complexity, and the need for interpretable and explainable models. Negotiating such hurdles is crucial for the enhancement of integrating mathematical models into clinical decisions. It stresses the need to pay close attention to the quality of data, the number of samples needed, correct and appropriate model selection, and continuous learning to minimize the risk of having ineffective and unreliable models when implemented in real-life situations.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology including artificial intelligence, the issue related to power consumption of current electrical and electronic devices has become increasingly serious. Hence, there is a pressing need to design and develop high-performance materials that can meet the critical demands for low power consumption and high energy conversion efficiency. Soft magnetic amorphous alloys (SMAAs) and their derivatives, mainly including soft magnetic nanocrystalline alloys (SMNAs), are nowadays state-of-the-art energy-saving materials due to their high permeability (μ), low coercivity (Hc), low saturation magnetostriction (λs) and high saturation magnetic induction (Bs), which result in low core loss and high energy conversion efficiency, particularly for high-frequency applications. Over the past few decades, compositional design, structural modification and subsequent process control have been utilized to enhance Bs, increase μ, reduce Hc and decrease λs. Through a comprehensive survey on these results in literature, this review article aims to clarify the key factors influencing the soft magnetic properties of SMAAs/SMNAs from both experimental and theoretical viewpoints and further uncover the mechanisms underlying the correlations among composition, structure, processing and properties as well as their coupling effects. In addition, the current industrial application status of SMAAs/SMNAs is summarized together with the related technological challenges that impede their potential applications. To sustain the rapid development of SMAAs/SMNAs, new perspectives are also proposed for making possible breakthroughs in their soft magnetic properties and cost performance, which may trigger new research realm and further extend their application range.}

This study applies the Theory of Consumption Values to examine how consumers develop satisfaction with ChatGPT's product recommendations, while also critically assessing the relevance of each value dimension in the context of AI-mediated interactions. Drawing on a randomized online experiment with U.S. participants, we investigate the relationships between customer satisfaction with ChatGPT's responses and five perceived consumption values: functional, emotional, epistemic, social, and conditional. We also investigate if trust plays a mediating role in these connections and whether they differ depending on the task type (requiring mostly human or machine skills) and product attribute (functional, experiential, hybrid). The findings indicate that, except for social value, all value dimensions are strongly linked to greater levels of satisfaction; the most significant correlation is found for functional value. Trust significantly mediates the value–satisfaction relationship, with conditional value exhibiting the most substantial indirect effect through trust. Interestingly, functional value plays a more prominent role in associating with satisfaction for experiential and hybrid products, as well as in human-skill-intensive tasks, rather than in functional products or machine-skill-oriented tasks. Conditional value consistently shows both direct and mediated associations with satisfaction across functional and hybrid products, as well as both task types. Epistemic value demonstrates both direct and mediated associations with satisfaction in functional and experiential product contexts, as well as in tasks requiring primarily machine-based skills. These findings advance theoretical understanding of value perception in GAI interactions and offer practical insights for designing context-sensitive and trust-oriented recommendation systems.}

This model jointly optimizes class balancing, feature extraction, and the classification process within a unified AdaBoost architecture. Initially, the weight updating mechanism leverages instance confidence to prioritize boundary-proximal instances. Subsequently, dynamic undersampling and dynamic oversampling modules are integrated during the AdaBoost iterations in order to construct a more distinct decision boundary. Ultimately, the dynamically sampled dataset is dimensionality reduced using discriminability improving Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) to provide a more discriminative low dimensional manifold input to the base learner. Experimental results demonstrate that GDDSAD achieves an average increase of 0.208 in the G-Mean and 0.111 in the AUC on 4 CVD datasets compared to AdaBoost, and outperforms mainstream Boosting variants on 6 KEEL datasets, demonstrating its ability to accurately identify diseased instances in imbalanced CVD datasets.

To address this gap, our study aims to explore information non-behaviour and examine the reasons for disengagement. A qualitative approach was employed, involving recruiting 20 participants through snowball sampling. The participants were older Chinese immigrants with diabetes in Canada. Data were collected through semi-structured, one-on-one interviews and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. The study revealed that participants disengaged from active information behaviour by avoiding new information, passively accepting or ignoring what they encountered, failing to apply or critically assess it, and seldom sharing it with others. This non-behaviour was influenced by contextual factors (e.g., environmental barriers, access challenges, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), social factors (e.g., viewing diabetes as a non-topic, social support networks, and doctor-patient interactions), and individual factors (e.g., health condition, coping mechanisms, perceived usefulness of information, and health literacy). The findings highlight the complexity of human behaviour and point to new avenues for future research. Practically, this research contributes to designing patient-centred educational programs, developing accessible and relevant communication tools, and fostering environments that encourage active information engagement.}

abstract = {Thermal protective clothing (TPC) and the air gap (AG) beneath it protect human skin during the heating phase by insulating and storing heat. However, during the cooling phase, the stored heat can become a secondary source, potentially causing thermal damage to the skin. In this study, a three-dimensional coupled heat transfer model was developed for a TPC system with a vertical AG. Indices were proposed to quantitatively evaluate the thermal protective and hazardous effects of the TPC and AG on the human body. Results showed that air density was crucial to the heat transfer mechanism within the AG. Compared with a temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, assuming a constant value for air (0.025–0.035 W/(m·K)) overestimated its protective performance. The thickness of the AG was directly related to non-uniform skin thermal injury (spatial variation in skin damage across different vertical positions). During the heating phase, airflow within the 6.4 mm AG remained steady, producing a uniform laminar distribution. In contrast, inward helical flow (a spiral circulation where air moved upward and inward, cooled near the skin surface, and recirculated downward toward the fabric) was observed in the 12 mm and 18 mm AGs. In the cooling phase, larger AGs released less stored heat to the skin. Increasing AG thickness from 6.4 mm to 18 mm not only improved thermal protection during exposure but also reduced skin heat absorption during the cooling phase by up to 14 %. Skin surface heat absorption was influenced by both AG thickness and height. These findings clarified the distinct thermal roles of the fabric and the AG during both heating and cooling phases, highlighting the AG's dual function in insulating against external heat and reducing residual heat release to the skin. The results provided theoretical support for optimizing AG thickness beneath TPC to reduce the risk of delayed skin burns.}

The effect of the ratio of hydrophilic to hydrophobic groups on the performance of the dispersants was also discussed to understand the molecular composition of the macromolecular polycarboxylate dispersants with polyether as the side chain and the effect of this ratio on the dispersion of hydrophobic dyes. When hydroxyethyl acrylate was used as the hydrophobic monomer and the molar ratio of hydrophilic to hydrophobic groups was 2:1, the average particle size of the dispersed dye solution was 292.9 nm, smaller than that of the milled commercially available dye. The zeta potential of the dye using MHT-4 as a dispersant reached −36.7 mV. Furthermore, the synthesis process of MHT-4 was straightforward, and the prepared dye solution demonstrated that the dispersed dye particles were characterized by small particle size, centralized distribution, and stability, making it easy to dye polyester fabrics with a suitable dyeing rate. Therefore, MHT-4 is an efficient dispersant suitable for dyeing with disperse dyes.}

These gadgets are used to support motor function rehabilitation, assist in mobility, and enhance life of patients. Assimilation of robots within treatment allows the healthcare practitioners to deliver pertinent, standard, and repeated instructions, which are vital in encouraging rehabilitation motor plasticity. Rehabilitation robotics assists patients in regaining their functionality or regain motor skills, which is more helpful to patients suffering from neurology like stroke or spinal cord injury. These systems allow accurate and intense therapy, since the patient’s limbs move through exercises predetermined by the system and with a degree of flexibility and effort that is always uniformly high. Robots for rehabilitation has introduced artificial practice for persons with motor disabilities as it offers accurate and repetitive training that is needed in the therapy. Exoskeletons in motor function, soft robotics, and virtual reality systems are development of functional independence and patient involvement. In this chapter, the modern opportunities of using robotic technologies in the rehabilitation process with reference to the benefits and the integration of robotic technologies into therapeutic strategies are explored. Concerns including cost and availability are addressed, along with technology that guarantees a safer, more inclusive, and efficient encounter in health.}

It ranks as the second most common intraocular neoplasm in the adult population and is recognized as the most prevalent ocular tumor within this cohort. Despite its rarity, UM possesses the potential to manifest as a severe malignancy, leading to a variety of detrimental consequences, including visual impairment, exenteration (the total surgical removal of the eye and surrounding structures), metastatic spread, and ultimately, mortality. Contemporary investigations suggest that similar predictions extrapolated from comprehensive DNA or RNA analyses may hold relevance for immunotherapeutic applications. The quantification of protein expression levels, whether through conventional immune-histochemical techniques or more advanced methodologies such as mass spectrometry, may aid in the identification of biomarkers, particularly within the framework of immunotherapeutic approaches. While considerable efforts remain necessary, the significant advancements in technology and the improved understanding of disease pathogenesis achieved in recent years are anticipated to yield clinically relevant assays for biomarkers in the foreseeable future. This manuscript analyzes the prevailing constraints and underscores the prospective utility of biomarkers in the diagnosis, prognostication, and early intervention of UM.”}

It is critical to achieve a comprehensive strategy that acknowledges the deep connection between geodiversity and biodiversity in maintaining ecological functions. Key examples include the impact of geodiversity on carbon sequestration, climate regulation, its fundamental support for biodiversity, and its role in several aspects of culture. Incorporating geodiversity into environmental policy and planning is vital to enhancing ecosystem resilience and sustainability. Integrating geosystem services into broader environmental management strategies can lead to a holistic approach to conservation and sustainability that aligns with interdisciplinary scientific research and public policy frameworks.}

Conventional wisdom and most research in tourism and hospitality suggest that people want to spend as little as possible on services and receive maximum benefits to perceive something as valuable. Based on service-dominant logic, theory of value, and praxical value conceptualization, we propose and demonstrate that, contrary to the conventional wisdom, when multiple actors co-create value, “the more they contribute, the more they value.” The findings suggest that through value co-creation (VCC) processes in tourism and hospitality, when individuals invest their resources, knowledge, time, and effort, and collaborate with others, the more they contribute, the more they value the outcomes. In three experiments that simulate VCC in tourism and hospitality, co-creating experiences, and co-innovation in a resort setting, using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), results revealed that resource contribution increases one's value perceptions. Resource contribution in tourism VCC has a positive effect on one's perceptions of value, including co-created value, and on their subjective wellbeing, both for customers and hospitality employees. Furthermore, gender differences played a role in assessing resource contribution in VCC.}

Here, Ag/TiO2-x Schottky junctions with dual hydrophilic/CO2-philic interfaces were engineered through oxygen vacancy (VO)-mediated work function modulation and site-selective polydopamine (PDA)/ortho-aminobenzenethiol (o-ABT) modification. This architecture synergistically activates H2O oxidation and CO2 capture/activation, enabling efficient dilute CO2-to-CO conversion in gas-solid photoreduction systems. The optimized o-ABT@Ag/TiO2-x@PDA (o-AATP) achieves 271.2 μmol g−1 h−1 CO yield under 20 % CO2 atmosphere, surpassing pure CO2 conditions (256.3 μmol g−1 h−1) with 48.4-fold enhancement over pristine TiO2-x. Significantly, o-AATP retained > 99.1 % selectivity and stable performance throughout 30–5 % CO2 concentrations, highlighting exceptional adaptability to dilute CO2 atmospheres. Multi-scale studies combining in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that PDA coating and Vo synergistically enhance H2O dissociation on TiO2-x. The Ag−S anchored o-ABT ligand aligns the amino group to form N−H···OCO hydrogen bonds with CO2, enabling concurrent CO2 capture and activation. The hydrophilic/CO2-philic interface engineering and synergistic redox modulation achieve 3.91 % apparent quantum yield (AQY) under 20 % CO2 atmosphere, demonstrating enhanced photocatalytic conversion performance for solar-driven industrial emission treatment.}

The disruption of traditional industries, increased energy costs, and changes in land use are inevitable consequences of the low-carbon turn, often adversely impacting the least equipped to handle it. Vulnerable groups often face the greatest risks from climate change and the side effects of the policies designed to combat it. This study conducts a systematic literature review following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, covering publications from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Data were extracted into spreadsheets for descriptive analytics, and trends in publication years, countries, and policy tools were visualized with Python-generated heatmaps and summary tables. The findings reveal that despite best efforts to unburden vulnerable groups, many unaddressed concerns remain in the European 27 countries, where one might least expect them. The analysis highlights how one-size-fits-all policies ignore regional and social differences, disproportionately burdening vulnerable groups while favoring wealthier segments through subsidies and incentives. The mixed effectiveness of countermeasures—such as social tariffs, subsidies, and the Just Transition Mechanism—highlights ongoing challenges, including misrecognition, elite capture, and institutional constraints, while also underscoring notable successes like participatory community energy projects and locally tailored retrofitting initiatives. This research underscores the necessity of moving beyond uniform solutions, advocating for locally sensitive, equitable approaches that address affected communities' diverse needs and aspirations while ensuring social and environmental justice in the transition to a low-carbon economy.}

Herein, by fine-tuning cation distributions via pyrolysis metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), the geometric-site-dependent superexchange interactions in typical Mn-Cu spinel oxides were tailored and served as the ideal model to probe their intriguing roles and underlying mechanisms in toluene oxidation. The Mnoct-O-Cutet interactions (Mn in octahedra while Cu in tetrahedra) induced an impressive five-fold increase in toluene specific reaction rate, a four-fold increase in turnover frequency, and remarkably declined apparent activation energy from 71.0 to 41.0 kJ·mol−1 as compared to Mn3O4. However, the Mnoct-O-Cuoct interactions (Mn and Cu in octahedra) showed the unexpected opposite behavior and deteriorated the toluene specific reaction rate by 42 % and the turnover frequency by 18 %. In-depth experimental analyses and theoretical calculations revealed that Mnoct-O-Cutet triggered superexchange valence redistribution and electron delocalization, contributing to enhanced surface lattice oxygen activation. In contrast, the electronic interactions in Mnoct-O-Cuoct unit decreased the energy difference between Mnoct 3d and O 2p band centers and hence strengthened Mnoct-O covalence. This work highlights that not only the metallic combination but also the cation distributions should be carefully considered when designing polymetallic spinels, and provides fundamental insights into the origins of site-dependent metallic interactions in spinels, which sheds light on the rational design of polymetallic spinel oxides with optimized superexchange interactions and reinforced catalytic activities for VOCs treatment.}

abstract = {The rapid advancement of nano dermatology poses unique ethical and regulatory challenges, particularly in profit-driven cosmetic dermatology, where the pervasive use of nanotechnology raises complex ethical considerations. The key principles like justice, autonomy, beneficence, and nonmaleficence guide the discourse. The supporters argue for patient autonomy and desired procedures, claiming alignment with beneficence and justice, whereas opponents emphasize protecting patients from harm, regardless of mental competency. Furthermore, the concerns about the safety of nanomaterials used in cosmetic products, particularly regarding penetration into the skin, underscore the need for ethical guidelines to ensure patient safety and autonomy. Regulatory bodies like the Food and Drug Authority and European Commission have set guidelines to ensure the safety and efficacy of nanomaterials. These regulations cover aspects such as chemical and physical characterization, toxicity assessment, and labeling requirements. While some countries like Canada and Australia have established inclusive definitions and regulatory oversight, others like Brazil and India are in the process of developing specific guidelines for nanotechnology in cosmetics. Despite differences in regulatory frameworks, there is a shared commitment to protecting public health and promoting innovation in nano dermatology. Nano dermatology presents both promising opportunities and complex ethical and regulatory considerations. By establishing uniform ethical guidelines and stringent regulatory frameworks, policymakers, healthcare professionals, regulatory authorities, and industrialists can navigate these challenges and foster innovations in nano dermatology.}

abstract = {The scale of Earth systems means understanding climate change can exceed human perception, challenging efforts to appreciate and build support for adaptation planning at geosites. Geoheritage informs us of the current cycle of climate changes and expands our perception with evidence of earlier climate changes. Using the expanded understanding of the effects of climate change, procedures and examples are provided to help assess the risks to geoheritage, and the vulnerability of geoheritage assets to the drivers of climate change. Adaptation measures described include minimal intervention options, nature-based solutions such as beach replenishment, wetland restoration and hard-engineered protection in exceptional circumstances. Human responses to climate change impacts can also be significant to geoheritage including actions to minimise property damage and modifying geotourism infrastructure. Effective geoheritage communication can draw in visitors and stakeholders, creating a shared foundation of understanding and interest in Earth system stories, to inform conservation planning and management.}

abstract = {Drug-eluting implants offer a transformative approach to site-specific drug delivery with broad applications in oncology, ophthalmology, and contraception. These implants enable controlled and sustained release of therapeutic agents, thereby minimizing systemic exposure, reducing side effects, and enhancing patient compliance by eliminating the need for repeated injections. The mechanisms of drug release primarily involve diffusion, degradation, or surface erosion, and the implants can be composed of polymeric, metallic, biodegradable, or non-biodegradable materials. Targeted ocular drug delivery can be achieved through advanced carriers such as nanoparticles, liposomes, and microemulsions, which improve drug penetration, retention, and bioavailability. Drug loading strategies include soaking, molecular imprinting, and drug-polymer film embedding. A wide range of agents, including chemotherapeutic, immunotherapeutic, and gene therapy drugs, can be delivered via these implants. Emerging integration with biosensors facilitates biomarker monitoring, while diagnostic imaging technologies such as MRI, CT, and fluorescence imaging aid in evaluating therapeutic outcomes. Comprehensive evaluation includes in vitro release and cell culture studies, in vivo animal studies, and clinical trials focused on efficacy and safety, highlighting the significant potential of drug-eluting implants in precision medicine.}

They were collected for different purposes (e.g. scientific value, aesthetic appearance, archive significance) and therefore their use varies accordingly. Geoheritage collections disseminate knowledge, both for students and the general public. Acquisition policy is therefore guided by the preservation of a current state of nature, culture or mankind. Regarding acquisition, a new concern has arisen in the last years since science has been confronted by issues of land rights and rightful ownership. Acquisition policy has to conform with international conventions and the International Council of Museums Code of Ethics and needs to address two issues: the commercial value of geological samples and the political interest of governments.}

Assessing data quality, harmonizing data, and establishing standardized data structures become increasingly essential at DHM Stage 4. Advanced analytics and dashboards for reporting and visualization make data accessible and actionable by users and decision-makers across the micro-meso-macro-meta continuum of the enterprise. Real-world data now extend beyond local clinical decision support and contribute to population health initiatives and public health reporting. Various case studies from around the world illustrate and provide multiple insights into optimizing platforms and services. They also demonstrate the pivotal role of an established and mature DHM Stage 3 in supporting interoperable data and tools, as well as the optimal use of public and/or private commercial digital goods.}
