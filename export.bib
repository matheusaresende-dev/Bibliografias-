The consideration of the issues of education and training, as well as the workforce in child neurology, directly affects the very nature and identity of child neurology. How we educate and train those who will follow us, to whom we are accountable for the content and outcome of that education, and how we deploy the workforce we thus prepare define our very essence as child neurologists. These issues have been substantially altered by the effects on training and the workforce of the COVID-19 pandemic, through which we are still passing at the time of this writing. The effects of that event have been both so widespread and so subtle that it will likely take years for a complete understanding of how this changed medicine in general and child neurology in particular to emerge.},

   abstract = {The building sector in Western Balkan countries not only represents one of the main energy consumers (>40 %) but is also currently based on dated and low-efficient technologies far from EU standards. Therefore, implementing the energy transition in these countries requires a new type of professional with a stronger background in clean technologies and energy efficiency for achieving near zero energy buildings. Herein we present the efforts within the EU co-funded project ‘reZEB’ of a group of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) towards modernising the current content of modules and teaching methods in four Universities in Albania and Kosovo and one Vocational Education Training for energy efficient solutions and renewable energy technologies (RETs) in buildings. The selection of the modernised content and the design of the learning outcomes to be pursued was guided by an analysis of the labour market needs and the peculiarities of the existing study programs. More precisely, more than 80 organisations have been interviewed, showing great interest in professionals and engineers with enhanced knowledge on energy efficiency and RETs for the built environment, and 26 modules belonging to bachelor, master and professional study programs have been proposed as new or modernised (accounting for around 110 ECTS).},

   abstract = {This study is dedicated to establishing a new fatigue life prediction model for welded joints that comprehensively considers the effect of welding defects and the physical mechanism of fatigue failure. Firstly, an improved fatigue model for welded joints based on damage tolerance concept is proposed, in which fatigue-critical factors such as the geometric characteristics and location of welding defects are fully considered. Secondly, the proposed physical model is incorporated into a popular machine learning approach of support vector regression (SVR) that is suitable for training fatigue test data, such that a physics-guided artificial intelligence (AI) method is established. The developed method was then applied to predict the fatigue life of welded joints of GH4169 nickel-based superalloy under different fatigue testing conditions at high temperatures. The experimental results show that the life prediction accuracy of the proposed physics-integrated SVR method is significantly higher than that of purely physics-based or purely data-driven methods. Moreover, the proposed method also exhibits better prediction capacity and applicability compared with other physics-AI hybrid methods for fatigue assessment of defect-containing welded joints. This is supported by the fatigue mechanism confirmed by fractographic analysis, demonstrating the promising potential of this physics-integrated AI approach in fatigue life prediction.},

Due to its pivotal role in learners' lives, the pursuit of more effective interventions for developing CT skills among EFL learners remains ongoing. This study aims to examine how CT skills are fostered among EFL learners in higher education, as evidenced in published research. To achieve this, a secondary research method using the PRISMA systematic review framework was employed. The review systematically analyzed 47 published research articles selected from an initial search of 11,143 titles across eight online databases. The findings of the review are as follows. First, fostering CT skills in higher education has become a major concern among EFL educators and researchers in Asia. Second, the review highlights that both immersion and infusion approaches can effectively promote CT development, particularly when used in combination. Key strategies such as self-learning, discussion, and mentoring are central to these approaches, with a strong emphasis on collaborative learning and reflective practices. The duration of interventions plays a critical role: longer and more sustained programs tend to produce stronger outcomes. Additionally, the learning environment—whether traditional, web-based, or blended—impacts the effectiveness of CT interventions. Among these, blended learning consistently yields favorable results, suggesting that integrating in-class and online instruction is highly recommended. Finally, methodological factors generally enhance the outcomes of CT instruction. In contrast, personal factors (i.e., learner-related variables) can both support and hinder the development of CT skills, depending on context. Therefore, these factors may act as either enablers or inhibitors of CT skill acquisition under different conditions. This review proposes several educational implications to improve the cultivation of CT skills among EFL learners in higher education, focusing on instructional strategies, assessment methods, and learning resources.},

   abstract = {Sediment connectivity reflects the linkage between sediment sources and downstream sinks within geomorphic systems. Among available approaches, the geomorphometric Index of Connectivity (IC) is widely used, yet its accuracy depends on selecting weighting factors (WFs) that properly represent soil and surface properties. This study aimed to develop and evaluate composite WFs for IC in bare tilled soils by integrating both physical and mechanical attributes. Rainfall simulation experiments were carried out on three soils from Iran’s dry farming areas—Kouhin, Sararud, and Gachsaran—at a 12 % slope under 110 mm h⁻¹ , intensity. Additional tests were conducted on Gachsaran soil at 6 % and 25 % slopes. Soil losses were measured after each event, and high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) were generated to compute IC. Results indicated that IC weighted solely by rainfall intensity (RI) produced inconsistent outcomes, particularly across different soil textures, and even showed a counterintuitive decline with increasing soil loss at a constant slope. In contrast, incorporating mean weight diameter of aggregates (MWD), penetration resistance (PR), and RI as a composite WF yielded a strong and statistically significant relationship with soil loss (r = 0.998, p < 0.05). Spatial analysis further revealed systematic IC variation along the flume, with higher connectivity downslope, reflecting enhanced sediment transfer pathways. Overall, the findings demonstrate that incorporating both soil structural and mechanical properties greatly improves IC applicability in tilled landscapes. The proposed composite WF provides a more reliable basis for predicting soil loss and sediment delivery in rainfed, bare slopes, and warrants validation under broader soil and slope conditions.},

   abstract = {Public social programs—conceived as a response to societal demands for broader welfare coverage not only in Brazil but also worldwide—rely heavily on self-reported data from registries of low-income households to identify beneficiaries. Consequently, reliance on self-reporting possibly introduces biases and inefficiencies, undermining scarce public resources. To counter this, we embarked on designing a concise questionnaire for diagnosing poverty, which has the potential to increase precision, reduce administrative costs, and improve the cost-effectiveness of social programs—and thus ensure a wider social impact. The current study creates a tool-using machine-learning (ML) to better identify who needs help by using a quick, affordable, and data-based questionnaire that can sort and rank households by their risk of poverty. Unlike traditional methods of means test (MT), it avoids questions about household income. Instead, it relies on education level, the number of rooms, and the ownership of durable goods—all verifiable characteristics for a probabilistic poverty risk index. This report draws on the Poverty Probability Index (PPI), the Survey of Well-being via Instant and Frequent Tracking (SWIFT), and the World Bank’s "Pover-T Tests: Predicting Poverty" competition. The proposed approach introduces an innovation using a probabilistic risk index generated by a predictive model, promising to ensure social impact and a step towards innovative data-driven solutions. Ultimately, this research offers policymakers a robust instrument for the evaluation and optimization of social welfare programs, thus contributing more effectively to the fundamental goals of poverty reduction.},

   abstract = {While most literature on critical thinking emphasizes its cognitive dimension, this study explores criticality as a metacognitive experience in cultivating critical citizenship. Drawing on Paul Ricœur’s (1965/1970) hermeneutics of suspicion, it examines how criticality influences citizenship by encouraging individuals to evolve their interpretations of official discourses. Using Chinese citizenship education as a case study, narrative interviews with 12 purposively selected graduates from elite Chinese universities investigate changes in their interpretive stances over time. Thematic analysis identifies a four-stage, semi-iterative model of worldview transformation: participants initially accepted curricular content uncritically but subsequently encountered moments of suspicion that triggered metacognitive reflection and prompted reconstruction of their worldviews. Academic training contributed variably to this process. Confronted with everyday suspicions in social interactions and tensions between state narratives and personal interpretations, participants transformed themselves into critical beings through hermeneutic circle to reconcile these discourse gaps. Thus, the study advances understanding of how criticality can be unexpectedly activated, reflexively exercised, and intellectually directed to foster critical, reflexive, and deliberative citizenship. It also highlights the need for further research on the unintended civic effects of cultivating critical thinking, particularly its role in demystifying ideology, promoting epistemic autonomy, and constructing alternative worldviews.},

However, its effective implementation requires a systematic assessment of enablers and implementation feasibility across diverse HEI contexts. In this study, a novel T-spherical fuzzy (T-SF) hybrid model is developed to address this issue. The proposed model first collects expert evaluation information using T-spherical fuzzy sets (T-SFSs) and utilizes a similarity measure to determine expert weights. The weighted Heronian mean aggregation (WHMA) operator is then integrated to derive conservative aggregated values. Furthermore, the T-SF-WHMA-MULTIMOOSRAL hybrid model evaluates and ranks the metaverse integration across different types of HEIs. Finally, a case study is presented to illustrate the application of the T-SF-WHMA-MULTIMOOSRAL hybrid model. The results indicate that the continual feedback for teachers and students (Es7) and the sustainability and environmental impact (Es6) as the most influential enablers of metaverse integration.

Using two nationwide samples, the 2012 National Survey of Early Care and Education (NSECE) and the 2019 NSECE, we assess the relationship between features of early care and education centers and subsidy density, or the proportion of children enrolled that use subsidies. Our findings suggest specific features of centers— including the center’s enrollment and operational and financial structure— as well as their surrounding communities, are associated with subsidy density. Across both samples, enrolling infants or toddlers, having a quality rating or for-profit status, operating in an area with moderate or high poverty density, and receiving parent pay are associated with increased proportions of children using subsidies. Having a higher number of children enrolled and being fully enrolled are linked with decreased proportions of children using subsidies enrolled. Unique to the 2019 sample, receiving Head Start and public pre-K funds are associated with a higher proportion of children using subsidies enrolled in centers. Given the documented decline of centers receiving subsidies and evidence that centers may limit the degree of subsidy participation to sustain operations, understanding features of programs associated with subsidy density is critical to creating policies that support ECE access for subsidy-eligible children.},

   abstract = {This paper aims to assess the effects of the educational level of a country on the climate actions (adaptation and mitigation) that it adopts, and measure the extent to which social inequality, educational quality and access to schooling contribute to such actions. To achieve this aim, the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique was applied to a sample of 195 countries from 18 indicators related to education, income inequality, adaptation and mitigation that exist in global databases. The main results are a) the level of education has a positive effect on adaptation (.824) and mitigation (.927) actions; b) inclusion of the quadratic term for educational level further underscores its central importance in explaining mitigation action (.460); c) Likewise, the quadratic effect of income inequality emerges only as a propensity to mitigate carbon emissions (−.140); d) in absolute values, the difficulty of accessing education has an indirect effect (−.721) that is greater than that of educational quality (.302). These results indicate that, in addition to the need to guarantee education for all, countries also need to reduce their inequalities. Furthermore, developing countries should prioritize actions to include children and young people in climate change education initiatives, so that the indirect effects of climate change adaptation are realized, while reducing inequality can help to foster carbon emissions mitigation efforts. The policy implications of this paper are twofold. First, the paper highlights that improving access to education is more impactful than reducing income inequality for climate adaptation and mitigation. Second, policymakers should prioritize expanding educational opportunities, particularly in vulnerable regions, to enhance climate resilience and sustainable practices. Investments in education can drive long-term climate action more effectively than income redistribution alone.},

To assess the economic significance of our findings, we redefine successful financial education as achieving a Pareto-efficient outcome—ensuring that gains for newly educated consumers do not come at the expense of uninformed consumers.

   abstract = {How does the co-optation of foreign-educated elites influence local stability? This study exploits a quasi-experimental setting created by the establishment of provincial Consultative Bureaus in China in 1909 to examine the political consequences of integrating Japan-educated returnees into local governance. Using an original, prefecture-by-month panel dataset across 262 prefectures from 1901 to 1911, we find that co-opting foreign-educated elites produced unintended effects: it significantly reduced revolutionary armed struggles (the “revolution effect”), but simultaneously increased peasant revolts (the “revolt effect”). Mechanism analysis suggests that returnees advocated reforms that intensified local tax burdens—particularly in economically strained regions—provoking peasant revolts. Our findings underscore a critical trade-off in the modernization efforts of autocratic regimes: when elites’ reformist ambitions outpace the adaptive capacity of society, well-intended reforms can generate unintended backlash.},

   abstract = {With the nations’ energy security under threat and prices rising, several countries are shifting back in their energy policy to nuclear energy. Leading the recent nuclear boom to dreams, not nightmares, will depend on how the waste issues are resolved. This study aims to understand and break down public acceptance, attitudes, and perceptions of new energy sourced from spent nuclear fuel in Japan. New energy sourced from spent nuclear fuel indicates a technology or application, such as nuclear batteries, that extracts and utilizes the remaining valuable energy from nuclear fuel already used. Based on a web survey of 1000 Japanese in 2022, we found no statistical difference in the absolute mean of public acceptance between new energy sourced from spent nuclear fuel and nuclear power. In addition, the simulation result predicts that acceptance will increase as assessed scientific knowledge on radioactive waste, radiation, and nuclear power-related information increases. Structural Equation Modeling showed that assessed scientific knowledge, trust in the government, and environmental awareness had significant effects on benefit and risk perceptions related to new energy, and both perceptions would directly impact new energy acceptance. The findings will provide insights into developing energy from or recycling technology for spent nuclear fuel.},

While previous studies have highlighted its benefits for students, there remains a gap in understanding how teachers can effectively implement it to promote students’ maker mindsets. To address this gap, we collaborated with four elementary STEM teachers engaged in a Lesson Study (LS) cycle. Our aim was to delve deeper into DTMP and analyze teachers' pedagogical practices in utilizing it. We conducted an analysis of a real classroom session, employing a hierarchical and nested coding scheme to assess the teachers' use of artifacts and questioning techniques. Our analysis uncovered three significant ways in which DT contributes to reframing ME provided by teachers engaged in the LS cycle: 1) utilizing DT process models to structure learning activities; 2) using DT toolkits to scaffold, visualize, and assess learning; 3) employing DT strategies to support questioning practices. Building on these findings, we developed practical recommendations to support teachers effectively implementing DTMP to develop students’ maker mindsets, bridging the theory-practice gap and enhancing student learning experiences.},

   abstract = {Modern design education requires innovative approaches to inspire and enhance creativity. Prior research suggests that cognitive stimulation levels significantly influence creative performance, with an optimal level known as the “sweet spot” effect. However, studies specifically addressing inexperienced designers remain limited. While mood boards are commonly used as visual stimuli in design processes, few studies, particularly in educational contexts, have explored the optimal level of stimulation. This gap may stem from challenges such as novice users’ limited expertise and the absence of refined instructional strategies. This controlled experiment aimed to explore whether an optimal level of stimulation exists in mood board design activities. Participants were classified into low-, moderate-, and high-constraint groups based on the degree of image involvement. The study employed the sweet spot framework, treating creativity level as the dependent variable and constraint level as the independent variable. Creativity in design sketches was evaluated across four dimensions: novelty, variety, quality, and quantity. Mood board effectiveness was subjectively assessed using three criteria: innovation, consistency, and visual attractiveness. The results indicated that the moderate-constraint group proved most effective in stimulating creativity across these four metrics. They also required less creation time than the high-constraint group. Moreover, moderately constrained mood boards demonstrated the largest number of significant positive correlations with sketch creativity. Furthermore, the study identified the characteristics of mood boards with low and high constraint levels. Based on these findings, this study proposes practical instructional strategies to foster creative education using mood boards.},

In this study, random forest (RF) and LIBS method were used to quantitatively analyze the brightness and identify the source of white porcelain in Xi'an. Firstly, the brightness of white porcelain fragments is measured, and the spectral brightness of white porcelain samples was analyzed quantitatively by LIBS platform. D2nd-VIM-RF calibration model was established for multi-element quantification, achieving excellent prediction performance with an R2CV of 0.9814 and an RPD of 4.6. Secondly, an RF classification model was developed to distinguish two types of white porcelain from Xi'an. Based on spectral data, the model was optimized using MSC-WT preprocessing and VIM-SPA variable selection, resulting in the MSC-WT-VIM-SPA-RF classification model. It achieved a sensitivity of 0.9670, specificity of 0.9438, and overall accuracy of 0.9600, significantly enhancing classification reliability. To optimize both the predictive capability and explanatory power of the model, quantitative brightness was incorporated as an auxiliary variable alongside LIBS spectra. Brightness reflects surface features such as glaze quality and microstructure, which are closely associated with raw material composition and firing techniques critical factors for distinguishing porcelain types. This study underscores the significant potential of combining LIBS and RF technology for rapid, minimally invasive analysis of ancient white porcelain, offering valuable insights into the classification, identification, and quantitative analysis of historical ceramics.},

To address this gap, our study aims to explore information non-behaviour and examine the reasons for disengagement. A qualitative approach was employed, involving recruiting 20 participants through snowball sampling. The participants were older Chinese immigrants with diabetes in Canada. Data were collected through semi-structured, one-on-one interviews and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. The study revealed that participants disengaged from active information behaviour by avoiding new information, passively accepting or ignoring what they encountered, failing to apply or critically assess it, and seldom sharing it with others. This non-behaviour was influenced by contextual factors (e.g., environmental barriers, access challenges, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), social factors (e.g., viewing diabetes as a non-topic, social support networks, and doctor-patient interactions), and individual factors (e.g., health condition, coping mechanisms, perceived usefulness of information, and health literacy). The findings highlight the complexity of human behaviour and point to new avenues for future research. Practically, this research contributes to designing patient-centred educational programs, developing accessible and relevant communication tools, and fostering environments that encourage active information engagement.},

   abstract = {Thermal protective clothing (TPC) and the air gap (AG) beneath it protect human skin during the heating phase by insulating and storing heat. However, during the cooling phase, the stored heat can become a secondary source, potentially causing thermal damage to the skin. In this study, a three-dimensional coupled heat transfer model was developed for a TPC system with a vertical AG. Indices were proposed to quantitatively evaluate the thermal protective and hazardous effects of the TPC and AG on the human body. Results showed that air density was crucial to the heat transfer mechanism within the AG. Compared with a temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, assuming a constant value for air (0.025–0.035 W/(m·K)) overestimated its protective performance. The thickness of the AG was directly related to non-uniform skin thermal injury (spatial variation in skin damage across different vertical positions). During the heating phase, airflow within the 6.4 mm AG remained steady, producing a uniform laminar distribution. In contrast, inward helical flow (a spiral circulation where air moved upward and inward, cooled near the skin surface, and recirculated downward toward the fabric) was observed in the 12 mm and 18 mm AGs. In the cooling phase, larger AGs released less stored heat to the skin. Increasing AG thickness from 6.4 mm to 18 mm not only improved thermal protection during exposure but also reduced skin heat absorption during the cooling phase by up to 14 %. Skin surface heat absorption was influenced by both AG thickness and height. These findings clarified the distinct thermal roles of the fabric and the AG during both heating and cooling phases, highlighting the AG's dual function in insulating against external heat and reducing residual heat release to the skin. The results provided theoretical support for optimizing AG thickness beneath TPC to reduce the risk of delayed skin burns.},

Given the critical role of creativity in engineering and design education, understanding how AI tools shape students’ ideation processes is essential for developing effective pedagogical practices. This study examines the impact of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, on creative ideation among undergraduate design engineering students. The research was conducted through a randomised crossover experiment, with students alternating between AI-assisted and unaided ideation tasks. A mixed-methods approach combined quantitative analyses of the 728 ideas generated with a qualitative evaluation of students’ interactions with AI. Results show that the use of AI did not reduce fluency, flexibility, or originality, nor did it lead to thematic homogenisation. However, semantic divergence was significantly lower in the AI-assisted condition, suggesting convergence in the way ideas were formulated. Additionally, AI-assisted ideas more frequently resembled existing products and exhibited reduced textual elaboration. A mixed between-within subjects ANOVA revealed that students who began with AI support produced more original and diverse ideas across both tasks, pointing to a lasting effect of early AI use. Qualitative analysis of student-AI interactions revealed important patterns, including predominantly passive and directive use, with limited exploratory or collaborative engagement. These findings provide new insights into human-AI co-creation and highlight the importance of promoting intentional, critical, and pedagogically guided use of generative AI tools in education.},

The effect of the ratio of hydrophilic to hydrophobic groups on the performance of the dispersants was also discussed to understand the molecular composition of the macromolecular polycarboxylate dispersants with polyether as the side chain and the effect of this ratio on the dispersion of hydrophobic dyes. When hydroxyethyl acrylate was used as the hydrophobic monomer and the molar ratio of hydrophilic to hydrophobic groups was 2:1, the average particle size of the dispersed dye solution was 292.9 nm, smaller than that of the milled commercially available dye. The zeta potential of the dye using MHT-4 as a dispersant reached −36.7 mV. Furthermore, the synthesis process of MHT-4 was straightforward, and the prepared dye solution demonstrated that the dispersed dye particles were characterized by small particle size, centralized distribution, and stability, making it easy to dye polyester fabrics with a suitable dyeing rate. Therefore, MHT-4 is an efficient dispersant suitable for dyeing with disperse dyes.},

   abstract = {Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by demyelination and immune dysregulation. Despite the established link with immune function, the genetic and pathological mechanisms connecting immune-related genes to MS remain incompletely understood.
Methods
We systematically integrated genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for various quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from public databases and literature, along with GWAS summary statistics for MS from IMSGC and FinnGen. Mendelian Randomization (MR) was used to infer potential causal relationships between immune-related factors and MS. To validate whether the same genetic variants underlie both traits, Bayesian colocalization analysis was performed. Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) further supported causality between the exposure and outcome. Finally, two-step MR was conducted to investigate whether immune cell subsets mediate the observed associations.
Results
Fc receptor-like 3 (FCRL3) was identified as a protective factor for MS, supported by MR analyses at multiple levels: circulating protein (OR = 0.912, 95 % CI = 0.882–0.942), blood-derived gene expression (OR = 0.772, 95 % CI = 0.598–0.997), and cerebral cortex expression (OR = 0.573, 95 % CI = 0.455–0.721). Causality was further supported by SMR (pSMR = 5.38E-04; pHEIDI = 0.478) and Bayesian colocalization (PP.H₄ = 0.915). The protective effect of FCRL3 on MS was found to be partially mediated by CD3 expression on naïve CD4+ T cells.
Conclusion
This study systematically evaluated the causal roles of immune-related genes in MS susceptibility and identified FCRL3 as a protective factor. These findings underscore the significance of FCRL3 in MS pathogenesis and suggest its potential as a target for future immunotherapeutic strategies.},

Conventional wisdom and most research in tourism and hospitality suggest that people want to spend as little as possible on services and receive maximum benefits to perceive something as valuable. Based on service-dominant logic, theory of value, and praxical value conceptualization, we propose and demonstrate that, contrary to the conventional wisdom, when multiple actors co-create value, “the more they contribute, the more they value.” The findings suggest that through value co-creation (VCC) processes in tourism and hospitality, when individuals invest their resources, knowledge, time, and effort, and collaborate with others, the more they contribute, the more they value the outcomes. In three experiments that simulate VCC in tourism and hospitality, co-creating experiences, and co-innovation in a resort setting, using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), results revealed that resource contribution increases one's value perceptions. Resource contribution in tourism VCC has a positive effect on one's perceptions of value, including co-created value, and on their subjective wellbeing, both for customers and hospitality employees. Furthermore, gender differences played a role in assessing resource contribution in VCC.},

This study endeavors to define transformative resilience through data-driven insights and explores trends in related research by mapping its topics and fields. We employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, which extracts key terms and insights into topics from a large volume of literature. We traced the evolution of research topics from 1951 to 2024 based on connections between citations. The data were sourced from the Scopus database using the query term “transformative resilience”, encompassing titles, abstracts, and keywords of journal articles, book chapters, and conference papers. We collected a total of 3110 related pieces of literature. We defined transformative resilience as a change of system structure accompanied by a shift in socio-political values and policy. The results of LDA showed that transformative resilience research has developed into seven fields: Innovation and Economic Policy, Supply Chain and Technological Response, Health and Social Well-being, Agriculture and Environmental Impact, Community Resilience and Disaster Recovery, Sustainability Theory and Practice, and Urban Governance and Planning. Based on topic evolution relationships, topics anchored in a context perspective have grown increasingly specialized and productive, while those rooted in a theory perspective have stagnated or remained underexplored.

   abstract = {Renewable energy is essential for achieving sustainable development in human society. As a renewable energy carrier, hydrogen holds significant promise as an alternative to traditional energy sources due to its high energy density, abundant availability, and zero-emission combustion. However, challenges such as high cost and low efficiency in hydrogen production, storage, transportation, and application contribute to its relatively low overall energy conversion efficiency. Therefore, establishing a comprehensive industrial system is crucial to advance the utilization of hydrogen energy. This review proposes an integrated industrial framework that includes offshore wind power and seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production, purification, storage, transportation, and application in fuel cells, offering a novel strategy for the development of the hydrogen energy industry. Additionally, we summarize advances in hydrogen storage alloys (HSAs), which can directly absorb hydrogen produced from seawater electrolysis and supply it at the required pressure for fuel cell applications. Based on their performance, we identify suitable HSAs from the existing studies that meet these criteria. These selected HSAs are integrated with hydrogen storage tanks and marine transportation to establish a completely coupled engineering system. This review offers insights into the future developmental potential of this system and its prospects for large-scale practical applications.},

   abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to green space was crucial for mental wellbeing, particularly in urban areas under lockdown. However, studies on the transition from strict containment measures to reopening are limited. This transition, while relaxing mobility and enabling free access to green spaces, also increases infection risks. Our study used a regression discontinuity design (RDD) with a unique dataset (N = 2545) from two major Chinese cities, Beijing and Shanghai, to examine the effects of the COVID containment policy shift on mental wellbeing and green space exposure. We compared participants by different green exposure categories to investigate variations in mental wellbeing during this transitional phase. The findings confirm that the policy does not promote short-term mental wellbeing, as measured by CES-D scores, self-rated health, happiness, and frequency of negative feelings. Residing 400–1200 m from a park, but not extremely close (within 400 m), confers mental health benefits. Visual exposure to greenery from windows bolsters mental wellbeing compared to limited greenery views, although the magnitude of this effect is modest. This study underscores the importance of urban green spaces in buffering mental wellbeing impacts of major policy changes during pandemic, highlighting their importance in urban planning and public health strategies.},

   abstract = {A new thiourea-based fluorescent chemosensor, ITCNOD, was synthesized in 89 % yield via the condensation of N-phenyl-o-phenylenediamine with 1-isocyanatonaphthalene in ethanol, and its structure was confirmed by ¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR, and HRMS analyses. ITCNOD showed a selective “turn-on” fluorescence response to Ag⁺ ions at 304 nm in DMSO/H₂O (1:1, v/v) with 50 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.0. Among several metal ions, only Ag⁺ caused significant fluorescence enhancement with minimal interference. Job’s plot, fluorescence titration, and Benesi–Hildebrand analysis confirmed a 1:1 binding stoichiometry, a high association constant (Ka= 9.69 × 10⁵ M⁻¹), and a low detection limit (1.68 × 10⁻⁸ M) for Ag⁺. The ITCNOD–Ag⁺ complex further enabled selective fluorescence quenching by tryptophan (Trp) among amino acids, with a LOD of 6.9 × 10⁻⁷ M and Ka = 3.5 × 10⁵ M⁻¹, indicating dual-analyte detection. Time-resolved and pH studies revealed optimal and reversible sensing between pH 7.0–8.0. The fluorescence enhancement is attributed to PET inhibition and ICT enhancement upon Ag⁺ binding, while Trp induces quenching through competitive coordination. This reversible “OFF–ON–OFF” fluorescence switching facilitated the development of an INHIBIT molecular logic gate, demonstrated through fluorescence logic circuits and EDTA/Trp cycling studies. ITCNOD’s practical utility was validated through Ag⁺ detection in real samples (water, soil, food, pharmaceuticals), with recovery rates of 94.1–102.1 % and strong correlation to ICP-OES (R² > 0.99). Additionally, paper strip-based testing and Escherichia coli fluorescence microscopy demonstrated the chemosensor’s potential for field-level diagnostics and bioimaging. The ITCNOD–Ag⁺ complex also showed visible colour change and in situ cellular fluorescence, confirming its dual-mode sensing capability.},

   abstract = {In the complex landscape of multi-dimensional coupling within intelligent manufacturing systems, optimizing decisions for the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is influenced not only by the assignment of machine resources but also by the interplay with the transportation system and the availability of auxiliary resources. In this paper, a multi-objective FJSP model considering limited transportation and auxiliary resources is proposed in the context of hydraulic cylinder manufacturing, aiming to minimize the maximum completion time and semi-finished product inventory cost. To address the problem, a reinforcement learning enhanced imperialist competitive algorithm (RLICA) is proposed. The algorithm has the following features: multiple hybrid initialization strategies are introduced to enhance population diversity and quality. Additionally, a dynamic parameter adaptation strategy based on reinforcement learning is designed for the assimilation stage to optimize the exploration–exploitation balance during the colonization assimilation process. Finally, a two-layer neighborhood search operator is implemented to improve the algorithm’s local search capability. The experimental section evaluates the performance of the algorithm based on 33 benchmark instances and real enterprise data. The results demonstrate that RLICA significantly outperforms five other state-of-the-art algorithms regarding convergence, distribution, and robustness. Case study further demonstrates that the algorithm can effectively coordinate transportation, processing, and auxiliary resource systems, offering a robust scheduling optimization solution for complex manufacturing scenarios.},

   abstract = {Old residential communities in Chinese cities are byproducts of urbanization and often suffer from poor living conditions and other negative issues. Due to prolonged neglect in maintenance and management, these communities are susceptible to external stigmatization. However, existing research rarely examines the effect of stigma on housing prices in such neighborhoods. To address this gap, this study explores the influence of stigmatization on housing prices in old urban communities, with a particular emphasis on the mediating role of the neighborhood environment. Utilizing street view image data and deep learning methods, this study constructs six indicators of the neighborhood environment: greenness, openness, walkability, imaginability, enclosure, and complexity. Based on these indicators, a hedonic pricing model and a mediation effect model are developed to empirically examine the complex relationships among old communities, neighborhood environment, and housing prices. To address the potential limitations of linear models, a robustness check was conducted by using a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) model combined with SHAP analysis. The results indicate that a significant stigma effect exists in old communities, leading to an overall decline in housing prices by 11 %. Further analysis reveals that this stigma effect can be categorized into a direct effect of psychological labeling (−9.6 %) and an indirect effect mediated by environmental factors (−1.4 %). The non-linear model produced highly consistent results, with the indirect effect mediated by the neighborhood environment accounting for 16.7 % of the total effect. These findings highlight the dominant role of social perception over physical conditions in shaping housing prices. The study offers empirical support for stigma theory in urban housing markets and provides practical implications for neighborhood regeneration strategies.},

Building upon the theoretical frameworks of Institutional Theory and Knowledge-Based View, this study aims to explore the key drivers that have propelled the adoption of KM strategies in the context of smart cities. The study adopted a mixed-methods approach for data collection, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. Quantitative data was gathered from 97 participants through an online survey, in which respondents assessed the significance of various drivers for knowledge management in the context of smart cities. Qualitative data was obtained through semi-structured interviews with 15 professionals across seven different organisations. The quantitative data was analysed using SPSS, while content analysis was adopted for the qualitative data. The findings of this study identified the five most significant drivers for managing knowledge in the context of smart cities. Therefore: to improve sharing of knowledge related to smart cities agenda, to protect loss of smart cities related knowledge due to key workers' departures, to help integrate knowledge assets related to smart cities agenda, to improve the capture of knowledge related to smart cities agenda, and to improve employee's productivity in implementing smart cities agenda. Using a mixed-methods research methodology, this empirical study explores the key drivers for managing knowledge in the context of smart cities.

To enhance oxygen utilization, the dead-end cathode mode (DEC) is employed and investigated under various purge operations at operating load levels in this study. Oxygen utilization is experimentally determined and used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) model via the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm at purge durations of 100, 500, and 900 ms. The ANN model is applied to predict oxygen utilization at purge durations of 300 and 700 ms, which are validated against experimental data. Furthermore, oxygen utilization is predicted at new purge durations of 200, 400, 600, and 800 ms. The model performance is evaluated and demonstrates a high correlation coefficient (R2), low mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The results indicate that, at the optimal purge duration of 100 ms and purge intervals of 35, 110, and 300 s, the maximum oxygen utilization of 9.4, 11.2, and 13.0 kJ L−1 is achieved under varying load levels of 0.8, 0.4, and 0.1 A cm−2, respectively.

However, effective communication of such policies is crucial to generate support and preserve guest satisfaction. Grounded in sound symbolism, this study examines how the pitch of a video voiceover influences the identifiable victim effect, ultimately shaping tourists' support for pro-environmental practices in hotels. Two experimental studies consistently demonstrate that a higher-pitch (vs. lower-pitch) voice leads participants to perceive the speaker as younger while simultaneously heightening their sense of victimization by environmental degradation. This voice-induced perception serves as a salient verbal cue that activates the identifiable victim effect through moral emotions. These findings extend our understanding of how voice pitch modulates both biological (age) and psychological (victimization) perceptions in video-based environmental communication. Practically, this study puts forward a way that tourism businesses can immediately and easily enhance the effectiveness of their pro-environmental messaging by adjusting the voice pitch.},

Moreover, we argue that this relationship will be more pronounced when there is lower opportunity for interpersonal knowledge transfer, and in particular when firms (a) have a large number of employees, (b) do not provide on-site employee training, and (c) have higher employee turnover. We use a unique combination of survey and social balance sheet data on a sample of 2268 Belgian firms.

   abstract = {Emulsion gels based on biomacromolecules have emerged as promising alternatives to those stabilized by traditional surfactants, addressing safety concerns in food applications. High amylose maize starch (HAMS) exhibits exceptional gel-forming capability due to its unique amylose-to-amylopectin ratio, rendering it a promising material for emulsion gels. However, its strong hydrophilicity and dense granular structure restrict interfacial adsorption, limiting practical applications. Herein, an innovative emulsion gel system based solely on HAMS was developed by integrating octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) modification with microwave treatment-assisted gelatinization, enabling efficient energy utilization, green clean-label production, and simplified processing. The effects of starch concentration (c = 2–8 %) and oil fraction (Φ = 30–60 %) on gel properties were systematically investigated to reveal the formation mechanism. Increasing the starch concentration or oil fraction improved droplet uniformity, self-supporting ability, gel strength, and water holding capacity. Furthermore, Cryo-SEM analysis revealed sufficient starch addition played a more critical role in stable gel network formation, which formed ''sheet-like'' networks, whereas oil droplets acted as active fillers and reinforced the gel matrix through interfacial starch-starch interactions. The stability analyzer indicated that higher starch concentrations and oil fractions synergistically enhanced the storage stability of emulsion gels. This study provides a green, clean-label strategy for HAMS utilization in emulsion gels, alongside insights into structure-function relationships and potential applications in fat replacement and bioactive delivery.},

   abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology including artificial intelligence, the issue related to power consumption of current electrical and electronic devices has become increasingly serious. Hence, there is a pressing need to design and develop high-performance materials that can meet the critical demands for low power consumption and high energy conversion efficiency. Soft magnetic amorphous alloys (SMAAs) and their derivatives, mainly including soft magnetic nanocrystalline alloys (SMNAs), are nowadays state-of-the-art energy-saving materials due to their high permeability (μ), low coercivity (Hc), low saturation magnetostriction (λs) and high saturation magnetic induction (Bs), which result in low core loss and high energy conversion efficiency, particularly for high-frequency applications. Over the past few decades, compositional design, structural modification and subsequent process control have been utilized to enhance Bs, increase μ, reduce Hc and decrease λs. Through a comprehensive survey on these results in literature, this review article aims to clarify the key factors influencing the soft magnetic properties of SMAAs/SMNAs from both experimental and theoretical viewpoints and further uncover the mechanisms underlying the correlations among composition, structure, processing and properties as well as their coupling effects. In addition, the current industrial application status of SMAAs/SMNAs is summarized together with the related technological challenges that impede their potential applications. To sustain the rapid development of SMAAs/SMNAs, new perspectives are also proposed for making possible breakthroughs in their soft magnetic properties and cost performance, which may trigger new research realm and further extend their application range.},

International agreements aim to increase the share of sustainable energy sources, which enhances the relevance of inverter-based resources (IBRs) interconnection lines. However, in power grids with IBRs, protection systems face challenges due to the behavior of voltages and currents. While phasor-based fault location is widely used, it is significantly impacted by fault resistance. Thus, the present article proposes an approach that combines apparent impedance techniques with machine learning (ML), using data exclusively from the substation, to accurately estimate fault locations in IBRs interconnection lines. Initially, a ML-based approach estimates the fault resistance and applies a compensation factor to estimate the fault current. The approach proved promising, reducing average errors in the fault location task to less than 1% without requiring new meters in the system, communication structures between transmission line terminals, or meters with higher sampling frequencies.},

Using the panel data analysis of 9091 government documents from 2007 to 2022, we systematically examine the diffusion mechanisms of China's low-carbon policies. Our findings reveal that learning, imitation, and coercion are the primary mechanisms driving the intensity of low-carbon policy diffusion, while economic competition plays an insignificant role. Furthermore, urban carbon emission levels and public environmental awareness promote policy diffusion, whereas energy consumption dependency inhibits it. By demonstrating an effective application of text mining techniques in measuring policy diffusion intensity, this study provides new methodological and empirical insights for understanding policy diffusion within multi-level governance systems.},

   abstract = {Innovative infrastructure projects are changing how cities and industries are developed by using advanced technologies to improve efficiency, sustainability, and resilience. These projects focus on managing infrastructure assets more effectively through real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and data-driven decisions. In this context, digital twin technology plays a key role by providing a virtual model of physical systems that updates in real time. By synchronizing real-time data with simulation models, digital twins support enhanced situational awareness, scenario testing, and performance optimization. However, implementing digital twins involves a complex process that introduces multidimensional risks, many of which are poorly understood. This study addresses the gap by identifying and analyzing key risk factors associated with digital twin adoption. A hybrid approach combines a systematic literature review, expert validation from 19 professionals, and fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory analysis to map and prioritize 15 critical risks across four categories: Technological, Governance/Ethical, Social, and Economic. Results indicate that economic challenges are central drivers, while data privacy and security, computational resource limitations, lack of transparency, job displacement, and high implementation costs represent significant secondary risks. Expert consultations identified practical strategies to reduce the top risks, including strong data governance, gradual (iterative) technology rollout, continuous performance monitoring, and designing systems with users in mind. These strategies directly address the most critical risks highlighted in the analysis. The structured risk framework provides actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners, supporting informed decision-making and robust risk management strategies. These findings enhance understanding of potential barriers and contribute to more sustainable and responsible deployment of digital twin technology in infrastructure and beyond.},

   abstract = {Agricultural systems are increasingly vulnerable to biological invasions and climate extremes, particularly drought, which can disrupt competitive balances and favor invasive weed establishment. Ecological strategies such as integrating temporary grassland phases into crop rotations offer potential to enhance system resilience, yet their long-term effectiveness under drought stress remains poorly quantified. A 12-year field experiment in western France was used to evaluated five rotational systems differing in the duration (3 or 6 years) and nitrogen fertilization of grassland phases within annual crop rotations. Weed invasion patterns were assessed using hierarchical statistical models, and an integrative drought stress index was developed to capture both the intensity and duration of water deficits over time. The influence of grassland management on invasive weed richness, temporal dynamics, drought sensitivity, and weed carryover between phases was examined. Invasive weed richness increased linearly with the proportion of annual crops, while systems with prolonged, well-fertilized grasslands exhibited significantly reduced invasion pressure—even under drought. Grassland phases buffered the effects of climate stress and minimized weed persistence across years, particularly when nitrogen inputs were adequate. Conceptualizing the system as a dynamic source–sink model revealed that crops serve as invasion sources, while well-managed grasslands act as ecological sinks that suppress invaders over time. These findings highlight the value of spatial–temporal diversification as a nature-based solution to reduce weed invasion in a changing climate. Incorporating extended grassland phases into rotations can strengthen agroecosystem resistance to invasive species and reduce dependency on chemical control strategies, contributing to the design of more sustainable and climate-resilient agricultural landscapes.},

The results reveal that: 1) The dominant urban expansion patterns in Chinese cities are shifting, leading to a more compact urban form. 2) During the study periods, QoUE values ranged from (0, 59.00] and (0, 61.18], respectively. The high-high clusters of QoUE are mainly in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration and Upper Yangtze River region. The low-low units are in Shandong and Xinjiang, respectively. The spatial clustering of infilling and edge-expansion quality enhances. And the values of the indicators on infilling and edge expansion patches are higher. 3) The tertiary industry as percentage to GDP (TIP) positively affects QoUE at a global scale, and the other factors affect QoUE at varying scales and directions. The results offer policy implications for sustainable land use and high-quality urban development. Moreover, the concept of urban expansion evaluation can be adapted and extended for broader applications.},

   abstract = {Rockburst is a severe geological disaster that poses significant challenges to underground rock engineering. In this study, true triaxial loading tests were conducted on cubic sandstone samples with a hole under four different hole size conditions to investigate the influence of tunnel size effects on rockburst evolution and fracture behaviors. Through electric potential (EP) technology and particle flow numerical simulations, the failure evolution of tunnel sidewalls and rockburst modes of samples were revealed. The influence of tunnel sizes on rockburst mechanisms and EP generation were further examined by analyzing the multiple-scale fracture features and electrical parameters. Results show that an increase in hole diameters alters the stress concentration distribution and crack propagation modes, leading to larger deformation, smaller rockburst strength, and broader affected regions. Rockburst-induced fracturing leads to microstructure changes, resulting in charge accumulation and significant alterations in the electric field, which in turn trigger anomalous response features detected by EP technology. The EP imaging sensitively captures damage features of rockburst, aligning well with stress field evolution. Moreover, the intensity and abruptness of EPs become more pronounced with increasing hole diameters. Three mechanisms are proposed to explain these observations. (i) The load-bearing capacity of rock mass weakens, which promotes rockburst initiation while suppressing rockburst strength. (ii) The local stress concentrations and initial fracture locations are altered due to changes in crack propagation paths, affecting both the extent and severity of rockburst. (iii) The lower stress concentration and slower energy release occur, resulting in a more complex crack network. Based on well agreement between experimental observations and numerical simulations, the study summarizes three distinct rockburst failure modes under the effect of tunnel diameters. These findings enhance our understanding of rockburst disasters in real tunnel environments and provide potential engineering measures for rockburst prevention.},

This study applies the Theory of Consumption Values to examine how consumers develop satisfaction with ChatGPT's product recommendations, while also critically assessing the relevance of each value dimension in the context of AI-mediated interactions. Drawing on a randomized online experiment with U.S. participants, we investigate the relationships between customer satisfaction with ChatGPT's responses and five perceived consumption values: functional, emotional, epistemic, social, and conditional. We also investigate if trust plays a mediating role in these connections and whether they differ depending on the task type (requiring mostly human or machine skills) and product attribute (functional, experiential, hybrid). The findings indicate that, except for social value, all value dimensions are strongly linked to greater levels of satisfaction; the most significant correlation is found for functional value. Trust significantly mediates the value–satisfaction relationship, with conditional value exhibiting the most substantial indirect effect through trust. Interestingly, functional value plays a more prominent role in associating with satisfaction for experiential and hybrid products, as well as in human-skill-intensive tasks, rather than in functional products or machine-skill-oriented tasks. Conditional value consistently shows both direct and mediated associations with satisfaction across functional and hybrid products, as well as both task types. Epistemic value demonstrates both direct and mediated associations with satisfaction in functional and experiential product contexts, as well as in tasks requiring primarily machine-based skills. These findings advance theoretical understanding of value perception in GAI interactions and offer practical insights for designing context-sensitive and trust-oriented recommendation systems.},

   abstract = {This study explores systemic barriers and enablers of post-growth food enterprises in Australia. We analyse three different case studies that offer alternative models of entrepreneurial approaches for achieving sustainability outcomes as a higher priority than economic growth. We identified three post-growth food enterprises that operate at different stages of the food supply chain. We found that these enterprises work towards various, interconnected, sustainability goals by embedding diverse principles into their organisational structure and operations. Their not-for-profit structure enables them to avoid trade-offs between financial extractivism and socio-ecological well-being goals. Additionally, we explored the systemic barriers faced by these enterprises, recognising that they are embedded in an economic system that favours and rewards the pursuit of economic growth. To navigate these barriers, the cases analysed adopted various innovative approaches, such as fostering alternative funding schemes, ways to acquire farmland and technology. While their bottom-up approaches are important, the inertia of dominant food systems impedes transitions to alternatives. We suggest that exnovation – the process of deliberately phasing out unsustainable practices – warrants more attention. For example, exnovating goals, policies, and performance metrics that prioritise economic growth at the expense of sustainability could play a crucial role in unlocking post-growth models. This study provides an orientation for further theoretical and empirical research about post-growth food systems transitions and stresses the value of engaging more with the wider political, economic, and legal foundations of transitions.},

Using the walking wheel foot as the research object, this work investigates the effects of solid orientation and soil moisture content on intrusion and lifting performance during complex solid actions. The intrusion and lifting processes were simulated using the EDEM discrete element method to analyze the micro-scale characteristics of the velocity fields and particle movement patterns in water-saturated soils under varying intrusion and lifting angles. At a constant soil moisture level, both intrusion resistance and lifting resistance decreased gradually with an increase in the intrusion angle of the solid. Regarding the influence of soil moisture content, the intrusion resistance of the solid exhibited a pattern of initial decrease, followed by an increase, and a final decrease. The primary and secondary influencing factors were determined through a two-factor analysis. Discrete element simulation results indicate that the solid’s impact on soil particles primarily forms a conical shear zone, with the disturbance range of the soil particles decreasing as the solid’s angle increases. Based on the intrusion tests and simulation results, a pressure-bearing mechanical model incorporating the solid's intrusion angle was developed. Correlation coefficients for farmland soils with varying moisture contents are provided, offering a new design reference and theoretical basis for advancing traveling device technology in wet and soft terrains, as well as for predicting solid performance.},

Adding gamification through serious games (SG) further enhances engagement and active learning. This study validates a VR-SG safety training previously evaluated in Colombia, now applied to 74 professional roofers in Germany comparing ViStra (VR-SG) with LeStra (lecture-based with problem-based learning). Using Kirkpatrick's model, we assessed reaction, cognitive and attitudinal outcomes, self-reported behavior, and safety climate through validated questionnaires. Both programs improved cognitive and attitudinal outcomes, with no significant differences. No effects were found for behavior or safety climate. Thus, ViStra matched LeStra's effectiveness. Post hoc comparison with Colombian data suggests cultural factors influence some outcomes, highlighting the importance of adapting training strategies to cultural contexts for future safety training strategies in diverse work environments.},

   abstract = {Current theories of relational learning based on structure mapping emphasize the importance of compositional representations, based on the concept's interconnections among its elements. We consider the possibility that relational concepts can also be represented unitarily, whereby the concept is a property of the stimulus as a whole. The distinction between compositional and unitary representations of relational concepts is a natural consequence of structure-mapping theory, but its psychological implications have not been explored. We report three experiments in which we examine how encouraging subjects to represent relational concepts compositionally versus unitarily affects learning on classification- and inference-based category learning tasks. Our findings showed that encouraging unitary representations led to better learning than encouraging compositional representations, especially for inference-based learning. We conclude that unitary representations incur less cognitive load than structural alignment of compositional representations, and thus may be the default for everyday relational learning and reasoning.},

   abstract = {Manipulating multi-metal interactions in spinel oxides offers great opportunities to develop highly efficient and robust catalysts for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) oxidation, but such potential remains largely unexploited or even causes suppressed activity due to the ambiguity in rational design metallic interactions and the poor understanding of the origins of metallic synergy. Herein, by fine-tuning cation distributions via pyrolysis metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), the geometric-site-dependent superexchange interactions in typical Mn-Cu spinel oxides were tailored and served as the ideal model to probe their intriguing roles and underlying mechanisms in toluene oxidation. The Mnoct-O-Cutet interactions (Mn in octahedra while Cu in tetrahedra) induced an impressive five-fold increase in toluene specific reaction rate, a four-fold increase in turnover frequency, and remarkably declined apparent activation energy from 71.0 to 41.0 kJ·mol−1 as compared to Mn3O4. However, the Mnoct-O-Cuoct interactions (Mn and Cu in octahedra) showed the unexpected opposite behavior and deteriorated the toluene specific reaction rate by 42 % and the turnover frequency by 18 %. In-depth experimental analyses and theoretical calculations revealed that Mnoct-O-Cutet triggered superexchange valence redistribution and electron delocalization, contributing to enhanced surface lattice oxygen activation. In contrast, the electronic interactions in Mnoct-O-Cuoct unit decreased the energy difference between Mnoct 3d and O 2p band centers and hence strengthened Mnoct-O covalence. This work highlights that not only the metallic combination but also the cation distributions should be carefully considered when designing polymetallic spinels, and provides fundamental insights into the origins of site-dependent metallic interactions in spinels, which sheds light on the rational design of polymetallic spinel oxides with optimized superexchange interactions and reinforced catalytic activities for VOCs treatment.},

   abstract = {Low-carbon transition research has experienced exponential growth in recent years, driven by the urgent need to mitigate climate change and achieve sustainability goals. The disruption of traditional industries, increased energy costs, and changes in land use are inevitable consequences of the low-carbon turn, often adversely impacting the least equipped to handle it. Vulnerable groups often face the greatest risks from climate change and the side effects of the policies designed to combat it. This study conducts a systematic literature review following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, covering publications from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Data were extracted into spreadsheets for descriptive analytics, and trends in publication years, countries, and policy tools were visualized with Python-generated heatmaps and summary tables. The findings reveal that despite best efforts to unburden vulnerable groups, many unaddressed concerns remain in the European 27 countries, where one might least expect them. The analysis highlights how one-size-fits-all policies ignore regional and social differences, disproportionately burdening vulnerable groups while favoring wealthier segments through subsidies and incentives. The mixed effectiveness of countermeasures—such as social tariffs, subsidies, and the Just Transition Mechanism—highlights ongoing challenges, including misrecognition, elite capture, and institutional constraints, while also underscoring notable successes like participatory community energy projects and locally tailored retrofitting initiatives. This research underscores the necessity of moving beyond uniform solutions, advocating for locally sensitive, equitable approaches that address affected communities' diverse needs and aspirations while ensuring social and environmental justice in the transition to a low-carbon economy.},

   abstract = {The Metal-Support Interactions (MSI) effect has been widely proposed and applied in catalyst design, playing a pivotal role in catalytic mechanism research and performance enhancement. However, in catalyst research as a branch of surface science, surface elemental distribution is often overlooked. This study systematically reveals the intrinsic relationship between ionic radius and surface elemental distribution in catalysts by synthesizing a series of Cu-Zn/MO catalysts. XPS, H2-TPR, and catalyst evaluation results show that the interaction between Cu and La2O3 is stronger. This characteristic leads Cu-Zn/La2O3 to exhibit the highest methanol yield per gram of surface copper (13.44 gMeOH/gCu/h), which is higher than Cu-Zn/Al2O3 (11.20 gMeOH/gCu/h). Further investigation demonstrates that due to the radius of Al3+ (0.53 Å) is smaller than that of Cu2+ (0.72 Å) and Zn2+ (0.74 Å); and the radius of Ce4+ (0.92 Å) and La3+ (1.03 Å) are larger than those of Cu2+ and Zn2+. Consequently, when Cu is loaded onto La2O3 and CeO2 supports, the active Cu component incorporates into the support lattice, resulting in fewer active components on the surface. In contrast, when Cu is deposited on Al2O3, the active Cu component remains well-dispersed on the catalyst surface. Furthermore, Cu-Zn/Al2O3 exhibited the lowest activation energy (22.85 kJ/mol). This study provides a new perspective for the traditional approach of solely focusing on MSI in catalyst design, emphasizing the importance of regulating surface elemental distribution.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT
Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) offers considerable potential to reduce water use and methane emissions in irrigated rice systems without compromising yields. However, despite decades of promotion, AWD adoption remains limited, especially in gravity-fed irrigation systems where institutional and agro-environmental complexities pose challenges to implementation.
OBJECTIVE
This study assessed the biophysical, socio-economic, and institutional determinants of AWD adoption at the turnout level in a gravity-fed irrigation system in Nueva Ecija, Philippines. The aim was to identify key barriers and opportunities for scaling AWD under spatially heterogeneous and rotationally scheduled irrigation conditions.
METHODS
Six turnouts within the Lateral G canal of the Upper Pampanga River Integrated Irrigation System were selected. Data were collected on plot elevation, soil texture, ownership patterns, water application, and grain yield. Water governance structures were analysed through focus group discussions and interviews with stakeholders. A decision logic framework was used to classify AWD adoption based on field-level water depth measurements.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
AWD reduced irrigation input by 21 % in the dry season and 50 % in the wet season while maintaining yields. However, adoption was constrained by elevation-driven water flow patterns, clay distribution, tenant-operated plots, and rigid rotational schedules. AWD adoption was more feasible during the wet season due to reduced irrigation risk. Weak farmer engagement in decision-making limited field-level adaptability.
SIGNIFICANCE
Scaling AWD requires reconfigured irrigation governance, integration of real-time water monitoring technologies, and economic incentives such as carbon financing. Context-specific, multi-level interventions are essential to enable large-scale AWD implementation in gravity-fed systems.},

   abstract = {Introduction
Dysfunction in amygdala networks has been implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD). Pharmacological treatments, such as esketamine and sertraline, are believed to exert their antidepressant effects by modulating amygdalar activity. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between changes in dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) within amygdala subregions and treatment outcomes, with a focus on identifying potential neuroimaging markers.
Methods
Twenty-eight patients with MDD received six intravenous infusions of esketamine (0.25 mg/kg) combined with 2 weeks of sertraline treatment. Mood and cognitive recovery were assessed using the HAMA, HAMD, BSI, and MoCA. Seed-based dFC analysis of resting-state MRI focused on the dorsal amygdala (DA), medial amygdala (MA), and ventrolateral amygdala (VA).
Results
All patients demonstrated positive responses to treatment, with significant reductions in HAMA and HAMD scores, as well as improvements in MoCA scores and a decrease in suicidal ideation. Following treatment, static functional connectivity (sFC) was reduced between the right DA and paracentral lobule, the left VA and multiple regions (including the lentiform nucleus, thalamus, medial prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, precentral gyrus, and superior parietal lobule), and the right VA and middle frontal gyrus. Conversely, dFC was significantly increased between the right DA and cuneus/superior parietal lobule, and between the left VA and superior parietal lobule. A decrease in dFC was also observed between the left MA and superior temporal gyrus. Correlation analysis showed that dFC between the left MA and superior temporal gyrus was positively correlated with HAMA score.
Limitation
The combined use of esketamine and sertraline limits the ability to differentiate their individual effects. A significant proportion of the patients were adolescents, with only a few adults, which may influence the age-related response to treatment. The study utilized the lowest effective dose of esketamine, thereby leaving the dose-response relationships unexamined. The small sample size further restricts the statistical power of the findings, highlighting the need for larger studies to validate these results.
Conclusion
Altered resting-state and dFC in amygdala subregions may play a role in the mechanisms by which the combination of esketamine and sertraline alleviates depressive symptoms, primarily involving the sensorimotor and default mode networks. Together, the sFC and dFC analyses provide an integrated perspective on depression-related connectivity changes and offer potential targets for treatment.},

The development of organic synthesis in water is of paramount importance from both the economic and environmental points of view. To that end, the solubility issue of most organic reagents and the catalytic performance issue of molecular catalysts need to be tackled. Inspired by enzymes, the immobilization of molecular catalysts into organic colloids provides access to the implementation of organic catalytic synthesis in water. Furthermore, the hydrophobic interaction-assisted immobilization of molecular catalysts creates hydrophobic microenvironments, provides pseudo-solvent effects, and enables the compartmentalization of incompatible catalysts. In this review, we review the recent advances in the hydrophobic interaction-assisted immobilization of molecular catalysts into organic colloids. Three types of techniques, including self-assembly of amphiphiles, mixing-induced nanoprecipitation, and miniemulsion polymerization, have been recently utilized for the construction of these catalysts. Their preparation, characterization, and applications are summarized and discussed. The design principles, positive effects, and structure-activity relationships of these organic colloids will stimulate the development of more sustainable chemical processes and more efficient enzyme mimics.},

Here, Ag/TiO2-x Schottky junctions with dual hydrophilic/CO2-philic interfaces were engineered through oxygen vacancy (VO)-mediated work function modulation and site-selective polydopamine (PDA)/ortho-aminobenzenethiol (o-ABT) modification. This architecture synergistically activates H2O oxidation and CO2 capture/activation, enabling efficient dilute CO2-to-CO conversion in gas-solid photoreduction systems. The optimized o-ABT@Ag/TiO2-x@PDA (o-AATP) achieves 271.2 μmol g−1 h−1 CO yield under 20 % CO2 atmosphere, surpassing pure CO2 conditions (256.3 μmol g−1 h−1) with 48.4-fold enhancement over pristine TiO2-x. Significantly, o-AATP retained > 99.1 % selectivity and stable performance throughout 30–5 % CO2 concentrations, highlighting exceptional adaptability to dilute CO2 atmospheres. Multi-scale studies combining in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that PDA coating and Vo synergistically enhance H2O dissociation on TiO2-x. The Ag−S anchored o-ABT ligand aligns the amino group to form N−H···OCO hydrogen bonds with CO2, enabling concurrent CO2 capture and activation. The hydrophilic/CO2-philic interface engineering and synergistic redox modulation achieve 3.91 % apparent quantum yield (AQY) under 20 % CO2 atmosphere, demonstrating enhanced photocatalytic conversion performance for solar-driven industrial emission treatment.},

   abstract = {Treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently considered highly challenging among various neurodegenerative diseases. The precision of AD diagnosis can be confounded by multiple factors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical tool for diagnosing AD. To assist physicians in clinical diagnosis, a new hybrid model, CTM-Net, is proposed based on MRI. CTM-Net incorporates a CNN enhanced by a channel attention mechanism to extract local fine-grained features from MRI slices, which are then mapped into high-level representations. Subsequently, the model integrates a Transformer's multi-head attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies across MRI slices. The local continuity of features between two adjacent MRI slices is enhanced using a one-dimensional convolution operation, which gradually fuse spatially adjacent features to ultimately obtain global MRI information. CTM-Net was validated on the ADNI dataset. It achieved 92.70%, 83.00%, and 79.07% accuracy on the three classification tasks of AD vs. CN, AD vs. MCI, and MCI vs. CN, respectively. Compared to other models applied to AD classification tasks, the proposed model yielded superior results in terms of accuracy. CTM-Net is a Convolution-Transformer hybrid model for AD classification and diagnosis tasks, which can combine the advantages of the CNN and attention mechanism to make the most of interactive information between local lesion features and global context features for improving diagnosis efficiency.},

While it is important to apprehend how people recover from these disasters, little is known about the role of saving in the process of disaster recovery. This paper empirically investigates dynamics in the saving behavior induced by storm events. Using an event study design and merging data from the Penn World Table with the EM-DAT database for 176 countries in a 69-year long period, we find a decrease in annual private saving rates by 1.85 and 2.29 percentage points four and five years following storms, respectively. Further results indicate that storms slow down per capita labor income growth by about 3 percentage points in the first two post-storm years. For intensely damaging storms, it follows a fall in saving rates by 3.19, 4.98, and 4.59 percentage points in the third, fourth, and fifth post-storm year, respectively. Declining international aid, financial access, coverage of social protection and labor programs, and rule of law within the first three post-storm years precede the falling saving rates. Robustness checks using the ifo GAME database reveal that the propensity to dis-save following the strike of a storm is instantaneous in developing countries, while it is delayed by up to three years in developed countries where people have a buffer against intense storms.},

This model jointly optimizes class balancing, feature extraction, and the classification process within a unified AdaBoost architecture. Initially, the weight updating mechanism leverages instance confidence to prioritize boundary-proximal instances. Subsequently, dynamic undersampling and dynamic oversampling modules are integrated during the AdaBoost iterations in order to construct a more distinct decision boundary. Ultimately, the dynamically sampled dataset is dimensionality reduced using discriminability improving Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) to provide a more discriminative low dimensional manifold input to the base learner. Experimental results demonstrate that GDDSAD achieves an average increase of 0.208 in the G-Mean and 0.111 in the AUC on 4 CVD datasets compared to AdaBoost, and outperforms mainstream Boosting variants on 6 KEEL datasets, demonstrating its ability to accurately identify diseased instances in imbalanced CVD datasets.
