	abstract = {This study investigates the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), specifically ChatGPT, into a flipped classroom model for woodworking skill training in engineering education. Traditional woodworking instruction often struggles with limited preparation resources, reduced time for hands-on practice, and the challenge of addressing diverse learning needs. To overcome these issues, ChatGPT was used to generate pre-class learning materials, including conceptual tasks and personalized quizzes, and to provide immediate feedback and automated formative assessments. The research adopted an action research methodology involving 32 university students with varied Kolb learning styles in a semester-long woodworking course. The course was structured in three phases: AI-supported pre-class preparation, in-class skill application, and post-class reflection. ChatGPT-generated content was implemented alongside Google Forms and Moodle quizzes to create an adaptive learning environment. Results from descriptive and inferential analyses show that the AI-enhanced flipped classroom improved students’ pre-class engagement and skill proficiency. Differences in learning outcomes were also observed across learning style groups, suggesting that personalized learning pathways can be effectively supported by generative AI. Qualitative feedback indicated that students appreciated the tailored content and valued the ability to receive on-demand support during their self-study process. This study presents a scalable instructional model leveraging GAI to promote personalized, skill-based education. The findings highlight the potential of ChatGPT to support differentiated instruction and provide insights for designing intelligent learning environments in engineering education. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Integrating undergraduate learning assistants (ULAs) into high-enrollment science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses has been shown to enhance student engagement, yet the impact on ULAs themselves remains underexplored. This manuscript presents a field-tested framework for implementing and sustaining a structured ULA program in a General Microbiology course, offering a replicable model for educators seeking to enhance student learning and ULA professional development (PD). Over the past decade, this program has been refined to provide structured mentorship, leadership opportunities, and active involvement in both in-class and out-of-class activities. The ULA program fosters student engagement by incorporating active learning strategies such as iClicker questions, group exams, and flipped classroom exercises, ensuring a collaborative and supportive learning environment. At the same time, ULAs develop critical skills in communication, teamwork, assessment, and pedagogy, which align with key PD objectives. Faculty observations indicate that students who engage with ULAs exhibit increased conceptual understanding, participation, and peer collaboration. Likewise, anonymous ULA feedback highlights significant growth in teaching confidence, leadership, and academic preparedness. This article serves as a practical guide for educators by outlining a structured, adaptable curriculum, detailing strategies for faculty mentoring, and providing implementation best practices. While formal assessment of learning gains is ongoing, preliminary findings suggest that ULAs serve as valuable instructional assets while simultaneously benefiting from the experience. This dual impact underscores the importance of structured ULA programs in enhancing undergraduate education and preparing future educators and professionals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The development and application of the software tool “Take-Home Exercise/Exam” (THEE) in the graduate class “Introduction to Computer Aided Process Engineering” (Intro CAPE) addresses gaps in process simulation pedagogical conveying and presents a novel approach to learning practices. These gaps exist in theoretical frameworks, in assessment strategies, and in methods for individualised student evaluation, particularly under digital and online constraints. The novel THEE tool introduces a secure and fully online assessment framework that enhances student engagement and supports independent learning through flipped classroom methodologies while ensuring academic integrity. Implemented in the Intro CAPE course, THEE facilitates individualised assignments, automated grading, and immediate feedback, establishing a new standard for pedagogical practices in process simulation amidst the growing trends of digitalisation and remote learning. The application of THEE in the Intro CAPE curriculum led to notable improvements in student performance and increased course registration rates relative to declining student enrolment in the department. Regular assessment allowed targeted adjustments of content to support students' long-term development. Student feedback highlights the benefits of a flipped classroom structure, which encouraged deeper engagement with the course material. THEE embedded into the new course structure enables examinations in an introductory course by providing the resources for exercise and exam tasks with different skill levels. Future enhancements will focus on improving instructional videos, and testing more complex process designs to allow for a gradual improvement of student capabilities and self-guided learning. The aim is to develop a long-term, flexible digital framework for exercises and exams, using THEE that integrates and builds on the increasing digitalisation and internationalisation in the process industries and in the education for chemical engineers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the flipped learning (FL) model has emerged as an innovative and increasingly popular approach to education, transforming how students engage with content and enhancing overall learning outcomes. This model reimagines traditional classroom dynamics by shifting from teacher-centered instruction to a more student-focused experience. In FL, students interact with instructional materials such as pre-recorded lectures, videos, or other multimedia resources outside class time. This frees up in-class hours for active, hands-on learning activities like discussions, problem-solving exercises, group projects, and practical applications that deepen understanding and foster collaboration. As such, the FL model holds promise in biotechnology education, where mastering theoretical concepts and hands-on skills is essential. By allowing students to acquire basic knowledge at their own pace before class, educators can dedicate face-to-face sessions to reinforcing and applying this knowledge in classroom activities. However, the success of FL often hinges on students’ attitudes and expectations toward the model. Those who perceive it as a valuable tool for deeper learning are more likely to fully embrace it, while skepticism or resistance can hinder its effectiveness. This study explores the attitudes and expectations of second-year students at the Biotechnology National School of Constantine, Algeria, regarding the potential implementation of the FL model. Through a questionnaire administered to 47 students, the research seeks to understand how these learners perceive the benefits and challenges of adopting FL in their coursework. The findings offer critical insights not only for English for Specific Purposes (ESP) practitioners but also for administrators and educators considering the integration of FL into biotechnology classrooms and similar ESP contexts. By understanding students' perspectives, educators can design and deliver FL experiences that align with learners' needs and expectations, ultimately fostering their engagement, motivation, and academic success. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In addition, we delineate the role of student assessment and teacher–student interactions in the flipped learning teaching strategy. In this study, we compare academic achievement and student perceptions of instruction in a lecture-based and a flipped classroom. The results show that the students in a flipped classroom had higher grades than those in a lecture-based classroom. In addition, students in the flipped classroom assessed the learning materials, activities, and evaluations more positively than the students in the lecture-based classroom did. Students in the flipped classroom were also found to be more likely than those in the other class to perceive that they could apply the knowledge and skills they developed in the course. They also had higher motivation to learn than the students in the lecture-based class and perceived that the instructor generated a positive climate that fostered student participation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the first implementation of a flipped, one-week workshop on heat integration that was taught in Spring 2024 to the 3rd Year cohort of 138 students in Chemical Engineering at Imperial College, London. The “flipped” workshop consisted of three online lessons that cover the core materials on pinch design of heat exchanger networks, which the students were required to complete ahead of each of the corresponding three face-to-face class meetings, which focused on problem-solving exercises largely carried out by the students themselves. The paper describes the teaching methodology applied, presents and analyses the results of a survey conducted to assess the students’ perceptions and degree of satisfaction with the workshop. Learning outcomes relevant to the workshop topic, that is, the ability to design and optimize heat exchanger networks in realistic plant-wide settings, are also presented and compared to those of previous years. The main conclusion is that the short workshop format can successfully achieve the learning objectives, even for relatively large class sizes. Evidently, this workshop can be taught effectively in this concentrated form provided that the workshop participants are given access to the online lessons in advance of the class exercises. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Students often struggle to grasp and visualize genetic engineering or cloning, in which a piece of DNA is put into a plasmid so that a bacterium may be transformed to produce large quantities of genetic material. Here, we incorporate a hands-on activity featuring 3D-printed models of DNA plasmids and gene inserts within a scaffolded cloning curriculum, designed to enhance student learning and engagement. As students physically manipulate 3D-printed models, with periodic guidance from the instructor, students may refine their scientific thinking about cloning after engaging in lecture-based materials. Uniquely, this activity may also be utilized as a flipped classroom activity to recapitulate a recorded lecture viewed beforehand. The hands-on activity changes the dynamic of a passive learning experience to one that is more active and beneficial for both the student and instructor. Here, we demonstrate that as this scaffolded curriculum builds, so does student understanding and performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

These techniques are effective in enriching the teaching-learning process, providing students with a more interactive approach. Methodology: The methodology implemented during the 2023-24 academic year by the “InMaths” teaching innovation group at the University of Cantabria is presented. The methodology included the production of videos, their integration into computer practical classes, and the analysis of their impact on learning the use of software in mathematics. Results: Results from 300 surveys across all subjects included in the study indicate that the implementation of the flipped classroom strategy with audiovisual support improves student motivation and participation in their learning. Students value the videos positively and believe that this strategy better prepares them for practical activities. Discussion: The results are consistent with previous research indicating that the flipped classroom strategy can enhance student preparation and participation, although the evaluation experience with control and experimental groups only showed grade improvements in some subjects and student groups. Conclusions: The methodology can help students develop a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and improve their skills in solving problems with specific software. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This research article introduces a hybrid methodology encompassing project-based learning (PjBL) and flipped classroom (FC) approaches. It is aimed to advance the comprehension of the implementation and benefits of FC and PjBL methodologies, particularly within engineering education. The hybrid methodology was implemented in a Mechanical Engineering program during the first semester of 2022. It was designed to address synchronous class restrictions caused by the pandemic, leading to online classes via the Microsoft Teams platform. The population consisted of 101 students from various semesters and courses. Implementation involved quizzes, workshops, a classroom project, and personal challenges as evaluation activities. The FC materials included explanatory videos, solved problems, readings, and slides. These materials were organised on the Moodle platform. The research employed quantitative and qualitative methodologies, formulating five hypotheses and designing a 14-indicator survey. The data were analysed using statistical methods such as Cronbach's alpha, Guttman's split-half, Kolmogorov–Smirnov, KMO analysis, Bartlett's test, principal component analysis, Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA, and Spearman's rho. Results indicated excellent reliability of the survey indicators, non-parametric data, and good adequacy of the proposed structure. Analysis indicated that the implementation of this methodology leads to significant benefits in terms of satisfaction, emotional engagement and stimulation levels, resulting in more effective learning and preference over the traditional approach. The perception of technology, timing, and content of videos varied among different courses. Positive comments from students supported the benefits of the hybrid methodology. It was recommended to improve the selection and quality of study materials. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Intelligent technology provides opportunities for educational innovation, and its introduction into tourism English teaching and the construction of a flipped classroom model can help improve students' professional competence and cross-cultural communication ability, and cultivate composite talents in line with the industry's needs. Based on the concept of Content-Based Instruction (CBI), this study adopts the Learning Channel Smart Teaching Platform to build a flipped classroom teaching model, which is implemented through three stages of teaching: self-study before class, guided study during class and study after class, and conducts a semester-long comparative experiment in the School of Tourism, University C. The experimental results show that the mean score of students' tourism English in the experimental class reaches 85.76 points, which is 11.17 points higher than that of the control class, and the difference is significant at the 1% level. The passing rate of the students in the experimental class reaches 100% and the excellence rate is 27.08%, much higher than the 84.78% and 4.35% of the control class. The questionnaire survey shows that 78.02% of the students think that the flipped classroom teaching enhances the learning motivation, 77.56% of the students think that it improves the understanding of the course content, and 82.76% of the students are satisfied with the way of course assessment and evaluation. The flipped classroom teaching mode based on the Learning Express platform not only enhances students' learning interest and performance in tourism English, but also strengthens teaching interactivity and optimizes the learning experience. In the experimental class, 74.99% of the students were willing to actively interact with the teacher in the classroom, which was significantly higher than the traditional teaching mode. The study shows that the flipped classroom teaching with intelligent technology support can effectively improve the quality of tourism English education, and provides new ideas and practical references for the reform of tourism English teaching in colleges and universities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study explores the SRL behaviors of engineering students in a flipped classroom employing a problem-based learning (PBL) approach, using process mining to analyze event logs from an intelligent learning platform. The findings revealed that students' SRL behaviors deviate from the traditional linear sequence, exhibiting diverse and non-linear pathways across forethought, monitoring, control, and reflection phases. Notably, reflective activities often occur in isolation, highlighting the need for structured interventions to promote timely and integrated reflection. Additionally, students frequently relied on peer discussions during pre-class tasks, which enhances engagement but raises concerns about originality and critical thinking. Based on these insights, this study proposes strategies to optimize flipped engineering learning, including designing structured pre-class tasks and embedding reflection framework. These findings offer practical implications for enhancing teaching and learning in engineering education. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The teaching of chemical engineering in higher education presents multiple challenges due to the complexity and abstraction of its fundamental concepts. Traditional methodologies often fail to fully engage students or foster deep understanding, highlighting the need for innovative pedagogical approaches. This study compares the effectiveness of two tools used in the flipped classroom methodology: educational videos and ChatGPT, an interactive artificial intelligence tool. Conducted over the second semester of 2023 with 45 third-semester Chemical Engineering students at a private university in Mexico, the study randomly assigned students to either the video group or the ChatGPT group. Data was collected using the PEPAI questionnaire, supplemented by classroom observations and performance assessments. The Mann-Whitney U test revealed significant differences in notetaking and preparedness for class exercises, with the video group outperforming the ChatGPT group. However, no significant differences were found in other areas such as content clarity, time spent, and ease of collaborative activities. These findings suggest that while ChatGPT has potential, it is still in a settling phase for both students and teachers. The study underscores the importance of careful integration of new technologies in education and provides practical guidelines for enhancing flipped classroom experiences. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The promotion of active learning has been demonstrated to be an effective method for students to construct their knowledge and develop higher-level competencies. However, it does require a certain amount of teaching preparation and an understanding of its benefits by the students. As it implies more work in class, students tend to resist it. This work presents a didactic approach in a physics course in a civil engineering major, over two years. A continuous assessment was set up to support a flipped classroom approach in the theoretical classes. The results demonstrated that students who perceived the benefits of the active learning tasks and engaged in the weekly study and performance of the proposed tasks achieved significantly higher academic results. Overall, 72% of the students who embraced the active learning continuous assessment and engaged in the weekly tasks achieving more than 8 values (out of 20), were approved in the course. In contrast, of those who were reluctant to make this effort, only 33% completed the course. It was notable that the working students, when embracing active learning, achieved success (100% both years) and also higher grades. The number of types of active learning tasks undertaken was also significantly correlated with student results (and higher for working students). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This research’s objective was to evaluate the potential integration of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, in chemical engineering education. In a course that employed flipped learning as an active learning strategy, the use of videos as a pre-class preparation activity was replaced by ChatGPT. The study employed a quantitative research design with an exploratory approach, with a sample size of 41 students. The efficacy of integrating ChatGPT was assessed by contrasting the normalized learning gain between the focus and control groups. The results of the descriptive statistics and the t-test indicate that there is no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of the normalized learning gain. The principal findings regarding the utilization of ChatGPT in chemical engineering curricula are as follows: first, it has the potential to enhance the explanation of fundamental concepts; second, it presents a challenge in tasks that require complex calculations; and third, it offers an opportunity for developing critical thinking in students. This research contributes to the existing literature on the use of ChatGPT as a tool in flipped classroom and highlights the ongoing need for further work on instructional design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It highlights the potential of helping students to understand the cutting-edge technology-enabled application cases complemented with video clips in improving each aspect of English listening, speaking, reading, and writing (LSRW) in computer science. Background: Traditional teaching practices in CPE are based on learning materials that outdated the rapid technological development and controlled type of educator-centered approach. Intended Outcomes: The proposed pedagogy is intended to maximize students’ engagement and be applicable to computing-related courses. Application Design: The overall design is student-centered. All learning and teaching (L&T) activities are conducted via blended learning in classroom and digital platforms. A hybrid pedagogical framework is designed by integrating outcome-based education, on-/off- line combined interactions, flipped classroom, and inquiry-based case-analyzing approaches. Each timetabled class is broken down into different sessions in which the CPE LSRW skills can be evenly developed accordingly. Learning experience and outcomes are tracked by module questionnaire, half-term and end-term surveys, module assessment results, and post-module evaluation. Moreover, lecturer’s practices cored with vision, values and beliefs are examined, ensuring a professional identity perceived by deploying the proposed pedagogy. Findings: Positive responses from students attest to the efficacy and applicability of the designed module content and the proposed pedagogy. Future extension will include more diverse cohorts and explore the long-term impact of the study on their career development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

While flipped learning has been widely used in various educational settings, its effectiveness in the context of test review lessons remains underexplored. This study evaluated outcomes between an experimental group utilizing flipped classroom strategies and a control group receiving traditional lecture-based test review. The experimental group participated in a three-phase flipped instruction process that integrated pre-class, in-class, and post-class activities. In contrast, the control group adhered to a traditional test review approach. Comparative results showed that students who experienced the flipped approach markedly improved test performance compared to those receiving traditional instruction. Survey data further revealed that these students enhanced engagement levels, appreciated the structured learning activities, and developed an enhanced ability to identify and address personal knowledge gaps. Additionally, the narrower score distribution in the experimental group suggested that this approach may help create a more balanced learning outcome among students.

	abstract = {Contribution: This study examines the effective-ness of a flipped classroom approach combined with dialogic teaching in STEM education. The primary contribution is the development of a methodology centered on discussions between the professor and students, guided by questions. The entire class is organized around these discussions, rather than merely asking occasional questions during the session. With pre-class reading, students focus class time on in-depth discussions that enhance comprehension and critical thinking, promoting active learning and student participation. Evidence from 163 first-year students highlights both the benefits and challenges of this teaching strategy. Background: Active learning enhances student engagement and academic performance, particularly in STEM fields. Dialogic teaching facilitates meaningful interactions that refine students' understanding, while the flipped classroom shifts content delivery outside of class, requiring students to prepare beforehand. This integration of strategies explores how pre-class preparation and in-class questioning enhance knowledge retention, engagement, and critical thinking. While these approaches are well-established, empirical evidence on their effectiveness in higher education contexts remains limited, highlighting the need for further investigation into their impact on student outcomes. Intended Outcomes: The methodology aims to create a student-centered learning environment where students arrive prepared, allowing class time for discussions driven by open-ended questions. The approach seeks to improve focus, comprehension, and retention while promoting a dynamic and inclusive classroom atmosphere that encourages voluntary participation and reduces anxiety. Application Design: Following the flipped classroom model, students read materials before class, allowing the pro-fessor to engage them with adaptive, open-ended questions. This focus on individual responses promotes deeper understanding and personalized feedback, creating a supportive learning en-vironment. Findings: Feedback indicated high satisfaction with the methodology, particularly in maintaining focus (mean rating of 4.2/5) and enhancing learning effectiveness (4.3/5). However, challenges related to participation (3.6/5) and confidence (3.4/5) were noted. Overall, the methodology was well-received, but further efforts are needed to address these concerns and optimize the learning environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flipped class and remote learning have grown significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid advancement of digital tools. We evaluated this innovative method's effectiveness for both students and teachers in an engineering sciences course. In a flipped class, traditional lectures are replaced with pre-prepared multimedia resources, which students must read through in advance. The students must arrive prepared before participating in class tutorial sessions, which have increased in duration due to the removal of conventional lectures. The multimedia resources include an online course created with the editorial channel Scenari and shared on the Moodle platform, incorporating texts, videos, and unevaluated exercises, along with documents and pre-filled handouts that encourage note-taking. Moodle tests are used to assess student comprehension and allow teachers to monitor their progress. The self-learning time is flexible and integrated into student's schedules to support their preparation. This approach aims to enhance knowledge acquisition through online courses compared to conventional lectures, where students struggle to stay focused. The in-class sessions are interactive workshops led by the teacher, promoting peer support, student engagement, and active participation. The flipped classroom transforms the teacher-centered model into a student-centered approach. Teachers practicing the flipped approach develop new competencies, including various pedagogy strategies, designing multimedia resources, remotely supervising different course stages to monitor student progress, and facilitating workshops. A survey of student appreciation, containing closed and open-ended questions over several years, allowed us to gain insights into students' perception and learning preferences. Based on 182 collected comments, a sentiment analysis revealed that most students valued the flipped class, which helped them to achieve the expected skills. However, about 20% felt destabilized by the removal of traditional lectures and struggled to keep up with the required pace of work. Therefore, the teacher should consider the workload and ensure that students feel integrated into a collective learning environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The student feedback collected over the years and the experience of running the practical software engineering course indicated that a handful of topics had a significant skill imbalance in the student population. To address this gap, flipped lectures were introduced for the identified topics. These combine video lectures, online resources, and tutorials that complement the other course lectures. The intervention was evaluated through video statistics, a survey, a focus group interview, and teacher observations. The survey was submitted by 31 students with one focus group to get insights into student experiences and challenges. Students felt optimistic about content delivery through flipped lectures due to learning at their own pace. The primary challenges identified are low student attendance and insufficient preparation among those present for lectures. A key factor contributing to low attendance is the availability of recorded lectures and the absence of mandatory attendance requirements. To address the issue of inadequate preparation, implementing backup presentations for select lectures is proposed as a mitigation strategy to reinforce students’ understanding of core topics. Interactive lectures have proven less effective, as many students do not review the materials or complete the exercises beforehand. This lack of preparation hinders active engagement and reduces the effectiveness of interactive teaching methods. Future work should incorporate more “code-along” sessions to address this issue, allowing students to participate actively during class. Additionally, dedicating class time to completing exercises could improve engagement and reinforce learning outcomes. Adding grade-related incentives to the interactive lectures and understanding the students’ time constraints might improve engagement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Software testing plays a critical role in the development workflow. Nowadays, the significance of teaching software testing principles is recognized to a greater extent than ever before. The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to investigate the effectiveness of using a flipped classroom-based context to teach software bug advocacy, and (2) to provide the student's perspective on using flipped classroom to learn how to advocate for a bug. A seminar activity dedicated to bug reports and how to advocate for a bug is the framework for this investigation, with students being split into teams with the aim to perform two major activities: poster creation for one of the strategies from the RIMGEN mnemonics and providing advocacy strategies for a 3 years old bug. The created artifacts and the answers to a questionnaire dedicated to the learning experience are used as tools to analyze and provide answers to research questions. The results show that flipped classroom-based learning is effective in teaching how to advocate for a software bug. Around 87.75% of students agreed that the poster creation activity helped them better retain the information. A percentage of 61.22% students agreed that time was spent more effectively in class since the text was read outside the classroom, and 82.66% of students also agree that this type of learning provides them with the opportunity to communicate with other students. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Through interviews with 25 educators responsible for 33 RE-related courses, the research highlights key challenges, including students’ difficulties with abstraction, modeling, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Educators employ instructional approaches like project-based and case-based learning, role-play, and flipped classroom methods to provide practical experiences and bridge the gap between academic learning and industry needs. However, resource constraints, large class sizes, and curriculum limitations continue to hinder the implementation of innovative approaches. Emerging challenges, such as integrating AI technologies into RE curricula, highlight the need for curriculum adjustments to reflect evolving industry trends. This research provides a comprehensive view of the RE education landscape in Switzerland and lays the foundation for future studies to address these persistent and emerging challenges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the evolving educational landscape of the 21st century, innovative pedagogical methods like the Flipped Classroom (FC) and Personalized Learning (PL) have increased renown. The FC methodology revolutionizes traditional teaching by moving initial concept exposure outside the classroom, allowing in-class time for interactive and practical activities. This approach increases a dynamic learning environment, enhancing critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration skills. Successful FC implementation involves comprehensive educational experiences utilizing digital resources and active classroom interactions. PL adapts teaching to individual student needs, recognizing diverse learning speeds and cognitive styles. By leveraging technology, PL provides customized educational experiences that increase learner autonomy and motivation, leading to deeper understanding and engagement. A case study on teaching C programming using a Personalized Flipped Classroom (PFC) approach illustrates the practical application of these methodologies. The course design includes structured planning, multimedia resources, and continuous evaluation, promoting effective learning. Students engage with instructional videos and practical exercises, promoting autonomy and active participation. The course covers fundamental programming concepts, with a thematic progression that balances foundational understanding and advanced topics. Despite challenges like increased workload and digital competency gaps, the PFC approach demonstrates significant potential in enhancing student performance and skill development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study compares the effectiveness of traditional teaching methods with a flipped classroom approach in two courses. The flipped classroom included asynchronous learning pathways with interactive videos, quizzes and in-class hands-on activities, while the traditional approach relied on lectures followed by guided exercises. The evaluation was conducted using grades, a motivation questionnaire (FAM) and open-ended surveys. Results show that the flipped classroom model improved student engagement, confidence, and collaborative skills, while the traditional approach maintained more structured guidance. Challenges such as time constraints and group dynamics were observed in both formats, though students in the flipped classroom reported higher satisfaction with active learning opportunities. These findings underscore the potential of the flipped classroom to enhance learning outcomes in technical subjects, provided sufficient resources and support are available. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study examines the implementation of flipped classroom (FC) approaches in two courses, C1 and C2, at the Faculty of Engineering (FI) of the Universidad de la República. We selected Robert Talbert's framework as our primary reference due to its effectiveness in characterizing and analyzing FC design and implementation. We used a qualitative approach to analyze FC methodologies in C1 and C2, utilizing syllabi, Moodle platform analysis, classroom observations, and teacher interviews. This research aims to elucidate FC elements, compare approaches, and gather insights to enhance educational practices in engineering, fostering faculty dialogue and advocating for innovative educational practices. The general design of the FC proposal for both courses distinguishes between individual study of theoretical and practical content and group classroom work. Following the pandemic, both courses have moved from two face-to-face theory sessions per week to one and have added new self-generated audiovisual materials to their existing class recordings. Moodle observations reveal the necessity of structuring individual student activities and providing feedback to prepare them adequately for group work. Classroom observations indicate that C1 focuses on individual student inquiries and theoretical content review, while C2 takes a more structured approach, addressing central concepts through dialogue, group exercises, and continuous guidance. Comparing the proposals with Talbert's framework shows the clearest alignment with C2, evident in guided planning and classroom design. For C1, it is crucial to continue refining the design to better guide students and promote active work in the classroom. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Pair programming is a successful software engineering practice in industry, but has seen mixed results in the classroom. Recent research suggests that pair programming has promise and potential to be an effective pedagogical tool, however what constitutes good instructional design and implementation for pair programming in the classroom is not clear. We developed a framework for instructional design for pair programming by adapting the problem-solving studio (PSS), a pedagogy originally from biomedical engineering. PSS involves teams of students solving open-ended problems with real-time feedback given by the instructor. Notably, PSS uses problems of adjustable difficulty to keep students of all levels engaged and functioning within the zone of proximal development. The course structure has three stages, first starting with demonstration, followed by a PSS session, then finishing with a debrief. We studied the combination of PSS and pair programming in a CS1 class over three years. Surveys of the students report a high level of engagement, learning, and motivation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

One of the active learning strategies is the use of flipped learning. However, flipped classrooms pose challenges due to reluctant student preparation in the pre-class learning requirements and general resistance from students to the modality. To address these challenges for a flipped engineering course in Numerical Methods, adaptive learning lessons that present content, assessment, and feedback based on student engagement and performance were created for pre-class learning using a commercial platform. The paper details how the lessons were developed, implemented in pre-class learning, and revised, creating a framework for other engineering educators who may want to duplicate them. An initial study of student behavior during the lessons showed that a low-performing student made many more attempts at the assessments while spending less time on the accompanying learning materials. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {— Project-based learning or Problem-based learning (PBL) is an effective student-focused, inquiry-driven teaching method which helps in enhancing knowledge acquisition and retention. PBL is identified with 5 principles: Problem identification and analysis, Project organization, Teamwork, Student-centeredness, and Project assessment. For the PBL implementation to be successful, it is important to have the course aligned with these 5 PBL principles. The context of this study is an undergraduate engineering course in its first year called; “Design Thinking for Social Innovation” offered in the author`s university. While the course majorly followed the PBL pedagogy, it lacked student ownership of learning and followed classroom teaching. Therefore, this study aims to promote student ownership of learning and assess its effect on their capacity to self-regulate their learning by developing content for students’ self-study in the online mode. To address the gap, the content of three modules was curated for online access and deliver the sessions in a flipped mode. This online intervention of learning material was offered to 35 students while the remaining 35 students took up the in-person version of the course. Both groups solved societal problems with immersive community engagement. A two-group design was used to study the impact of the intervention. The difference in self-regulated learning was measured using the existing questionnaire administered online at the end of the semester. Quantitative analysis using Mann-Whitney test was performed on the data. Results of the study reveal that statistically significant differences in SRL between the two groups for specific constructs, notably in Monitoring and Evaluation, where the flipped classroom showed an advantage in monitoring skills, while the in-person classroom demonstrated better performance in evaluation and planning skills. However, the faculty experience of conducting the course in flipped mode revealed that students owned their learning, which was evident through in-class discussions. Further, the authors aver that the success of PBL courses, especially at first-year of undergraduate engineering largely depends on the effort and time the faculty can invest, often beyond scheduled class hours. The authors conclude that that students' capacity to self-regulate their learning was unaffected by the implementation of flipped learning in a course that was already using the PBL format.Further refinement of the flipped PBL approach may be needed to optimize performance across all SRL constructs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Social constructivism theory embraces peer-to-peer communication that helps students understand, examine, and discern the process of knowledge construction. The Social Constructivism Flipped-Classroom Model (SCFCM) inverts the traditional classroom paradigm by providing content outside of class, often through online materials, and devoting in-class time to active learning and discussion. This study aims to investigate the impact of the SCFCM on the conceptual understanding of photocatalysis, a crucial process in environmental science and chemistry, particularly in relation to sustainability and sustainable development. Photocatalysis, being a self-sustained process, holds potential for addressing global challenges such as renewable energy and pollution reduction, both of which are central to achieving sustainable development goals. A quasi-experimental pre-test–post-test design was employed at a public sector university, involving forty-three (43) students in each of the flipped- and non-flipped-classroom groups. Assessment tools, including pre- and post-tests and an interest survey, were used to gauge students’ conceptual understanding of photocatalysis and their degree of learning interest. The same chemistry teacher, one who had eight years of teaching experience, taught both groups. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) results comparing students’ performance showed a significant difference in the performance of students in the experimental group compared to the control group. The multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) results, however, revealed substantial differences in attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction between the experimental and control groups. The findings highlight that the SCFCM improved students’ understanding of complex photocatalysis concepts and demonstrated its relevance to sustainable development, offering valuable insights into the potential of this teaching approach for Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) education, especially in addressing sustainability challenges. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: With the demand for more effective and engaging teaching strategies in higher education, there is an imperative to blend traditional and innovative methods to optimize student learning outcomes. To address this educational need, this study sets out to design and evaluate a hybrid learning approach that integrates a flipped classroom based on working process systematization (termed “W + flipped classroom”) teaching design with blended online and offline methods based on the BOPPPS (bridge-in, objective/outcome, preassessment, participatory learning, post assessment, summary, termed “B + BOPPPS”) teaching model and explore its application effects in the field of biological separation engineering. Methods: The undergraduate class of 2020 majoring in biomedical engineering from Huanghuai University was designated the control group (n = 74), while the undergraduate class of 2021 was chosen as the experimental group (n = 79). The control group received traditional teaching methods. The experimental group adopted the integrated “W + flipped classroom” and B + BOPPPS teaching models. After the conclusion of the teaching period, comparisons were made between the two groups in terms of course objective achievement, academic performance, and critical thinking skills. A survey was distributed to assess learning effectiveness. Semistructured interviews were conducted with teachers and students from the experimental group to evaluate teaching effectiveness. Results: The integrated “W + flipped classroom” and B + BOPPPS teaching models significantly improved the academic performance and critical thinking skills of the experimental group. The teaching evaluation revealed high levels of acceptance among both teachers and students, along with improved satisfaction with the teaching methodology. Conclusion: The integration of the “W + flipped classroom” teaching design with the “B + BOPPPS” teaching model provides a scientific foundation for future teaching reforms. This study serves as a valuable reference for implementing the OBE philosophy, enhancing learning outcomes, achieving engineering education accreditation, and cultivating high-quality applied talents in the field of bioengineering at applied universities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There is currently a strong trend in higher education toward adoption of active collaborative teaching and learning approaches to improve student performance particularly in large-sized (n > 240 students) introductory gateway science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes. This paper discusses an innovative approach: a blended-flipped teaching (BFT) model, with a collaborative teaching team (CTT). This model is a partially flipped teaching approach that includes modified elements from both the traditional lecture (TL) and the highly structured flipped (HSF) teaching approaches. As a student-centered teaching method involving collaborative group learning, the BFT with CTT model also includes active learning strategies such as preclass activities, active lectures, modified flipped recitation sections, modified process oriented guided inquiry learning (POGIL) group learning, and peer-led teaching. This new active, collaborative teaching model improves student success rates in large introductory STEM gateway courses. It also helps improve students’ ability to think critically and engage in meaningful problem solving, skills necessary for success in this class as well as more advanced STEM courses. In this study, each BFT course included a CTT team, which consisted of a unique arrangement of teaching assistants (TAs) and learning assistants (LAs) working together collaboratively. The TAs and LAs were assigned to smaller groups of students that remained the same for the entire semester, leading to the creation of several communities of learners (COLs) within the large-sized classroom. The COLs offered a carefully structured learning environment that provided support, stability, and motivation to all participants. The BFT with CTT approach enhanced student performance, including in underrepresented minority (URM) and Pell groups when compared to other similar non-BFT courses within the chemistry department. This two-year study occurred during a time when all university classes had to transition from 100% face-to face (F2F) in fall 2019 to fully remote teaching (fall 2020) because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite challenges faced by students and professors during this transition to fully online teaching, the data show that the BFT with CTT outperformed both the highly structured flipped (HSF) and traditional lecture (TL) approaches. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Statistical Quality Control is a subject present in many engineering degrees. Literature identifies shortcomings in the application of Statistical Quality Control in industry. Some factors include a lack of training, misunderstandings or failures in implementing Statistical Quality Control. Many authors suggest following new methodologies (e.g. Problem-Based Learning) to improve the teaching of Statistical Quality Control, but, in general, universities continue applying the traditional methodology based on master classes. In this paper, we propose a methodology to design interactive gamified environments, and apply it to improve the Statistical Quality Control teaching-learning process. This methodology is based on two phases. The first one focuses on the design of the formative itinerary. For this, taking into account the competencies and learning objectives, the teacher applies a divide-and-conquer approach to break down the content into concepts, elaborates a graph of dependencies (which reflects the dependencies between the concepts, their complexity and the required cognitive level) and designs the formative itinerary to define the order in which the individual modules will be presented, together with a strategy of controlled content exposure. This process generates a stable structure that will support the second phase, consisting of selecting diverse learning activities for each module to promote active, self-paced, reflective, and engaged learning. We apply this methodology by dividing the Statistical Quality Control content into modules that comprise the key concepts, creating a formative itinerary. Given that structure, for each module, we select learning activities that encourage active learning and we translate it all into a game-like tool. This tool not only includes gamification elements like scoreboards, stars, and a map, but it further innovates by including as learning activities interactive serious games that help to visualize and understand the Statistical Quality Control process, by performing real-life tasks, resulting in significant learning. It also incorporates other educational strategies to promote active learning, such as flipped classroom and the inclusion of formative assessment. The content exposure control is implemented through tests on quality control to ensure students’ assimilation of the concepts before allowing them to move on to activities or problems that require higher cognitive levels. We evaluate the methodology’s effectiveness through an experiment that shows that students who used the learning tool improved their knowledge (p-value < 0.001) in comparison to their peers who only attended a traditional master class. Students also thought that this type of application is a good complementary material for the course and that it helps to improve knowledge assimilation (score of 4.94 out of 5 points). © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {When teaching engineering technology, the instructor has a host of pedagogical techniques to consider when designing a course. How should the instructor deliver content? Which methods will make the course engaging and which will enable the students to learn the most? This exploratory study begins to look at this question within the context of the First-Year Engineering Technology (FYET) program at Purdue University Fort Wayne (PFW). PFW is unique from many universities in that it is historically a commuter campus that largely serves non-traditional students. It is within this context that our study looks at these different pedagogical strategies. The course under investigation is Introduction to Engineering Technology, where students learn concepts, such as using Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Unit Conversions, Calculation, and Engineering Equations. Each of these concepts was practiced by solving and doing in-class activities (ICAs). The way the class was structured for the ICAs was varied with different iterations of readings, work time, review, and lecture. The work time in class to complete ICAs was also varied using different methods such as group study, answers on the board, and tutorials. Additionally, the pedagogical strategies used in the interventions ranged from a group work environment with a flipped classroom to productive failure where students tried solving problems before any instruction. Students were asked on a survey at the end of the semester to rank which way to solve the ICAs was their “favorite” and which way they felt helped them to understand the material the best. Additionally, they were asked how they received the course content for the ICAs. Only students over the age of 18 were considered and only students within Construction Management (CM), Mechanical Engineering Technology (MET), and Industrial Engineering Technology (IET) were considered as the course was designed for these specific majors. The study looked at survey data collected at the end of the semester which asked students to evaluate and rank which of the pedagogical designs they liked best and which they learned the best with. The survey results of student perceptions were then analyzed to better understand the relationship between when students feel they learn best and when they most like the instructional methods. The results illustrated that students associate their enjoyment with learning. Additionally, the results showed that students preferred to be shown how to solve the activities and wanted the lecture content given with a chance to work after. The results of the study have implications for practices in engineering technology classrooms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Mechanics of Materials course is a core offering at the University of Connecticut, catering to students majoring in civil, mechanical, manufacturing, and biomedical engineering. Delivered in a flipped classroom format, students engage with video materials that cover the theory outside of class. In class, students focus on developing problem-solving skills, exploring real-life applications of mechanics concepts, and participating in multiple active learning activities. In 2020, the course underwent a redesign to align with inclusive teaching standards, aimed at providing support to neurodivergent students. For the Spring 2023 semester, the course was co-taught by two instructors, one a teaching faculty member and the other a tenure-track faculty member. The course was hosted in an active learning classroom, equipped with 34 spacious tables and 204 rolling chairs, fostering dynamic interaction between instructors and students. In contrast to traditional auditorium-style classrooms, this environment allowed for more-effective engagement during class time. While higher education faculty members frequently collaborate on research, most courses are taught by one faculty member [1]. Co-teaching typically involves instructors dividing the course content equally, with each instructor individually covering half of the classes. However, potential conflicts may arise in this approach due to differences in teaching styles and philosophies [2]. These differences may, in turn, affect the consistency of instruction and lead to a less satisfactory learning experience for students, potentially influencing student evaluations of teaching [3]. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of different strategies employed by the instructors to enhance inclusive teaching, and minimize potential challenges associated with coteaching. In this course, both instructors attended all lectures, with one leading the lecture and classroom activities while the other engaged with students, promoting interaction and discussion. The class featured diverse active learning methods, including teamwork-based problem-solving, hands-on stress analysis with physical models, think-pair-share activities using real-world examples, polling on mechanics concepts, and strength-based projects. Classroom activities were carefully crafted to align with neuroinclusive teaching practices, aiming to empower every student, with particular emphasis on supporting those who are neurodivergent. Instructors and the three teaching assistants provided consistent support during these activities, while students had the opportunity to explore the application of mechanical concepts in topics of personal interest through strength-based projects. Having a tenure-track faculty member as one of the instructors enriched the experience, providing interested students with the opportunity to participate in research-focused strength-based projects using their knowledge from the Mechanics of Materials course. This paper delves into the benefits, challenges, and practical details of implementing these strategies in a large, inclusive, classroom setting. To gauge the effectiveness of these strategies, two anonymous surveys were conducted at the end of the semester, soliciting student feedback on class activities and co-teaching practices. The results highlight student feedback on the course content, assessments, active learning strategies, and overall course management and suggest that the employed co-teaching style was perceived as harmonized and well-coordinated, with clear expectations. This paper aims to share best practices for co-teaching in a large engineering course while incorporating inclusive teaching strategies to enhance the learning experiences of students. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Over the years, the diversity of pedagogical approaches used in higher education has increased, with a transition from traditional classrooms to more active and participatory methods. In teaching Information Systems in Industrial Engineering, it is necessary to apply active methodologies to actual industrial contexts, whose adoption by students is perceived as a support in their professional training. This study aims to highlight the factors that can influence students' perception of the effectiveness of active learning in a university course in industrial engineering. To this end, a pedagogical intervention based on case studies and a flipped classroom was designed for a Management Information Systems course at a university in Chile. The proposed methodology for this research combines quantitative methods to understand industrial engineering students' perception of traditional versus active classes during an academic period. A demographic characterization questionnaire and the application of the StRIP questionnaire were used. The sample used is composed of students of the Management Information Systems course (N=53), separated into three sections: two sections where case studies and flipped classrooms were used and the other without intervention. A correlation analysis was performed between the variables explored between the groups. Student workers have a positive perception of the application of active methodologies. This association is most robust in students with more than four years of work experience. Based on the results obtained with the StRIP instrument and the demographic survey, it is shown that it is convenient to use this type of pedagogical methodologies for learning during management information systems, particularly in students already linked to the workplace. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The pedagogical design of a classroom, including the class environment, assessment methods, and learning outcomes, impacts everything that students do and learn in that course. There are many different methods of teaching that have emerged and been explored in engineering classrooms in recent years such as flipped classrooms, repeated testing, courses with in-class hands-on activities, and also many courses that continue to be taught in a lecture-based environment. Undergraduate Dynamics is one of the standard engineering courses for many engineering majors where the content is well established and has not changed in decades; however, the implementation of different teaching styles has had an impact on the way the material is presented and covered in the class. Through discussion amongst three instructors at different universities with different teaching styles they discovered notable differences in how each instructor writes, solves, and evaluates their course problems in undergraduate Dynamics. The three teaching styles include (1) a flipped, recitation-based classroom that uses a mastery-based derivation approach to solving problems, (2) a lecture style class using the SMART Assessment approach, and (3) a lecture style class with 3 levels of student participation worked into the class to engage both reflective and active learners. The instructors chose several standard dynamics problems to analyze, where each instructor tailored the problem statement for their course and included how they would require the students to solve the problem and how they would evaluate the solution. These problems will be assigned for future exams in each instructor's class, graded in their own style, and then evaluated as a team to assess student learning outcomes. This work-in-progress paper will present the differences in the style of the problem statement, solution, and evaluation for some of these dynamics problems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

As part of a three-year NSF-funded study, the project team implemented adaptive learning in a flipped numerical methods course for pre-class preparation, using multiple previous semesters of flipped classroom data as the benchmark. Assessment data from 330 students was collected at three diverse engineering schools using a final exam (i.e., for direct knowledge assessment) and the College and University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI) for student perspectives. Although some differences in the direct assessment measures with the use of the adaptive lessons were seen based on the particular school, the overall effects of the adaptive lessons were small, negative, and non-significant. The classroom environment results were more favorable for adaptive learning, with four of the seven environmental dimensions having notable positive effect sizes. In this article, we present information on the development and implementation of adaptive lessons in the RealizeIT adaptive platform as well as assessment outcomes by school and for the schools combined. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In Fall 2021, I started teaching 75-minute Chemical Reaction Kinetics Sessions. By the end of the Fall semester, I noticed the following challenges for me as an instructor: (1) to deliver the required contents in two 75-minute lectures per week and 15 weeks; (2) to help students climb the Bloom's taxonomy; and (3) to motivate positive teamwork. It is also hard for students to integrate the knowledge introduced through PowerPoint slides and pre-recorded videos in problem solving. Problem-solving studio (PSS) was designed to teach students how to solve engineering problems without resorting to rote memorization of algorithms, while at the same time developing their deep understanding of the course topics. This is a core skillset that would help me address the challenges that I am facing; however, each session usually takes up to one and a half to two hours. After I attended the PSS held by Dr. Joe Le Doux, Dr. Carmen Carrion, and Dr. Sara Schley at Georgia Institute of Technology through Engineering Unleash, I decided to try to incorporate PSS into the 75-minute Chemical Reaction Kinetics Sessions by making the following adjustments: (1) I introduced Decision Trees through a 'Guess the Animal' activity. This activity served as the icebreaker activity to promote teamwork and stimulate discussion. Decision trees are important in learning Chemical Reaction Kinetics concepts. (2) I paired students and rearranged the table from a traditional lecture to a four-student interactive table. This was designed to motivate students to participate in PSS. (3) I flipped the classroom by making reading assignments and quizzes for reading assignments. The quizzes were due right before the lecture. This can help me to cover the target contents and motivate students to come to my classroom prepared, so that I can focus on the key contents that most students were struggling with. (4) I left one session for in-class activity after each chapter. I started with well defined questions and then gradually moved toward less defined questions toward the end of the semester. (5) I adjusted the pace of PSS by combining small group discussions and large group announcements. By making all these adjustments, I was able to conduct PSS in 75-minute sessions without rushing my students. I was able to promote active participation of my students from 40% (Fall 2021) to 90% (Fall 2022) and significantly increased the confidence of my students in problem-solving and the average of quizzes and exams. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {According to NSF (2017), even though the number of minority students in America’s college-age population has been on the rise, those who choose Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) as their majors are significantly fewer. There is an urgent need for African Americans, being the underrepresented minorities in STEM-related domains, be provided with opportunities to increase their presence and achievements (Hansen, Palakal & White, Journal for STEM Education Research, 1–26 2023). This paper was to develop an active flipped learning (AFL) model to enhance engineering students learning. Instructional video, audio, lecture notes, and reading materials are developed while initiating active learning activities in class to engage students in active flipped learning. By monitoring 103 students’ engagement and identifying their motivation and learning strategies, a custom-tailored plan to fit each underrepresented student in STEM was formed, valued by two indicators: Engaged Learning Index and Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. After practicing the longitudinal research for three years from 2016 to 2018, some results were found during the procedure through ANOVA and correlation analysis on the collected data. The AFL model effectively promotes underrepresented students’ performance in various science disciplines such as engineering, physics, and mathematics, such as helpful to foster underrepresented students’ deep understanding of STEM disciplines and making them more engaged in STEM learning. In the future, the AFL can be potentially expanded to other institutions to help all students succeed in STEM classrooms and careers, to increase the national STEM literacy and be applied to non-STEM majors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The training of innovative high-quality professionals carries immense significance. As the cornerstone course in biotechnology, "Enzyme Engineering" directly impacts the students' caliber and industry development. This course aims to address pertinent issues present in the current curriculum delivery, such as inadequately optimized content, excessive dependency on textbooks, and reliance on monotonous teaching methods. By adjusting the course outline, updating the case material repository, and engaging students' enthusiasm, we developed a three-dimensional approach to instruct. This approach included a blend of online and offline components, interactive teaching through the flipped classroom methodology, heuristic teaching using problem-based learning (PBL) mode, and topic teaching via case studies. We also improved the assessment mechanism to stimulate students' enthusiasm for learning nurture their innovation capabilities. Our objective was to foster high-quality professionals with a robust foundation and practical expertise. Through teaching exploration and practice, we have witnessed significant improvement in both teaching efficacy and students' engineering practice and innovation abilities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Background: Previous research has provided evidence of the impact of flipped classrooms on student learning, but an understanding of the relationship between flipped classrooms, learning strategies, and learning outcomes is limited. Intended Outcome: The learning strategies used by students in the flipped classroom were examined, and the effectiveness of incorporating a guided reflective thinking mechanism into the flipped classroom teaching design of a digital logic (DL) course was evaluated. Application Design: Referring to the strategic learning model, this study integrated the mechanism of guided reflective thinking into the instructional design of a flipped classroom for first-year students in the Department of Electrical Engineering of a junior college in Taiwan. Findings: The results show that the flipped classroom teaching design that guides the reflective thinking mechanism can promote the development of students' strategies to enhance their attitude, motivation, time management, concentration, self-testing, and solving learning difficulties, thereby improving their performance in DL courses. Furthermore, self-testing strategies are the most important predictor of students' performance in DL courses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This research arises from the backdrop of the traditional teaching model in algorithmic courses, where a one-size-fits-all method was applied. The challenges appear as instructors encountered difficulties managing a class with diverse levels of assimilation, limiting the attainment of learning outcomes. Recognizing the need for a more adaptive and personalized model, the study introduces the Data Driven Flipped classroom model. This model provides a dynamic and personalized learning experience. Experimental research with computer engineering first year students at ESPRIT School of Engineering demonstrates the proposed model's effectiveness. Using this model, new learning activities were designed where we strategically employed pre-class Quizzes, in-class interventions, and post-class discussion forums to guide students through exercises of varying difficulty levels. An experimental study was conducted to evaluate students' results and impressions. Survey results of the students (N=60) who participated in the experiment (experimental group) were compared to the results of the students from the control group (N=60). Significant improvements in students' problem-solving abilities, especially among those with lower starting assessments, demonstrate the model's potential to alter education. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

While the original plan was to deliver this course face-to-face (F2F), the online mode of delivery was later adopted due to the spread of the COVID pandemic. This prompted the implementation of alternative pedagogical approaches, such as the flipped classroom approach (FLA), and offered to opportunity to assess new modes of learning. The new delivery method presents a number of learning and teaching challenges, such as the effectiveness of online resources, the language barriers of students, and the customization of traditional assessments based on the need for online courses. The paper discusses all aspects of teaching and learning strategies utilised in this module and compares them with a similar module taught F2F by the author in a traditional framework at the University of Strathclyde. Academic achievements (as demonstrated through assessments), students' satisfaction and engagement, and instructor reflection are among key measures used to evaluate the performance of the new approach. As the module is intended to be presented F2F class format in the upcoming years, the idea of maintaining the same teaching and learning strategy or revoking it will be discussed. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The use of online virtual teaching platforms enables educators to transition between face-to-face and online Teaching and Learning (T&L). Recently, traditional contact-based institutions adapted to accommodate T&L online, allowing exploration of different T&L environments (both in person and online) and approaches to instruction within these environments.Online classes can take place in three primary ways: virtual classes, pre-recorded sessions, or a combination thereof. These three modes of instruction promote the implementation of a flipped classroom and encourage the use of continuous assessments.This study examines student perceptions of the online T&L approach that renders the implementation of a flipped classroom and continuous assessment. These have increasingly been adopted by lecturers and facilitators in an engineering degree programme to accommodate the different learning environments and complement learning. Additionally, this study investigates student perceptions of the benefit of a five-year extended engineering degree designed to provide academic support and develop professional competencies in students. This study spans two years and lies parallel to a second paper that examines overall student perceptions of the different T&L environments in person and online, as well as the different T&L modes used to accommodate student learning online.A questionnaire consisting of closed- and open-ended questions was distributed to the 2021 and 2022 first- and second-year five-year engineering degree programme cohorts at the University of Pretoria. A quantitative data analysis of the closed-ended responses was conducted through ANOVA correlation tests.Results indicate that students do not perceive the benefits of a flipped classroom approach in the learning environments investigated, and the reasons for this vary from poor implementation from the lecturer/facilitator side to an inability to self-regulate one's learning from a student's side. Furthermore, there is an overwhelming preference for continuous assessment across all environments, as it highlights areas for development and encourages consistent reinforcement of content. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Mechanical engineers develop complex products consisting of multiple interacting subsystems, and product complexity has grown over time as sensing and communication elements have become ubiquitous. Developing these products requires engineers to take a holistic system-level view of the product and its context. Infusing systems thinking and systems engineering skills into the mechanical engineering undergraduate curriculum better prepares graduates to work on these complex systems. This paper describes the development of online learning modules for first-year mechanical engineering students that introduce the product development process while presenting fundamental systems concepts. The development of the online modules features a partnership between faculty, learning engineers, and student testers to convert materials previously presented in class into self-contained learning modules. These modules are designed to be suitable for a flipped classroom approach that allows using classroom time for “hands-on” activities based on the topics covered in the modules. The article describes the process to develop the online modules and the best practices learned for content conversion from classroom to online, embedded assessment, and protocols for student feedback, but does not include assessment results from a classroom implementation. The modules described in the paper are scheduled to be deployed in three institutions in the fall of 2024. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The Professional Training Kit for bilingual primary education leaders has been renewed as part of the development engineering preparation, led by the Higher Education Partnership Program-Morocco (HEP-M). The Kit includes a module of "Support for Basic Science Training", the main focus of this research. It aims to strengthen scientific knowledge related to the scientific awakening program among future teachers. The present study corresponds to a concrete reflective vision concerning the implementation of the module in question to enhance the standard of science education in primary schools Its objectives include: inventorying the management modalities, determining the constraints of adopting the syllabus in the current situation, and suggesting alternatives and/or effective solutions to better manage its activities. The results are gathered from nine regions using an online questionnaire consisting of 23 questions, addressed to life and earth science as well as physical science teacher-trainers involved in teaching the module at various CRMEFs across Morocco kingdom. The obtained results support the partial adoption of the syllabus in question. These findings argue in favor of the implementation of the "Support for Basic Science Training" module, which relies on a wide range of concrete and digital resources. However, the surveyed teacher-trainers have shown limited emphasis on the flipped classroom approach. Similarly, limited attention has been given to practical work and supporting self-training due to several constraints. In this study, we present the following preliminary recommendations for effective activity management: Introduce MOOCs in sciences to streamline the incorporation of the flipped classroom approach and guarantee assistance for self-directed learning; Guide the self-training of aspiring teachers; Supply well-equipped laboratories to ensure the practical work's feasibility; Review the entry requirements for CRMEFs; Reduce class sizes, and Establish a platform for collaboration and communication among science educators on a national scale. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom in computer science has become a popular pedagogy where students complete preparatory reading and videos before class, leaving class time for hands-on practice. In theory, students come to class predisposed with knowledge to complete programming tasks, quizzes, and homework assignments. However, if students do not complete or do not fully understand the preparatory material, those students will not be equipped for class and may also be embarrassed to ask questions during class. In this study, we created a gamified quiz that is powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) that loads in questions from the flipped content transcripts. The game offers students a fun assessment after completing the flipped content that will both motivate them and prepare them for class. The game also provides an anonymous way for students to ask questions as they progress through the game content. Those questions can then be analysed by the instructor and reviewed in class. The study compares in-class quiz scores of a control group versus a group that had access to the gamified quiz in an undergraduate software engineering course over three consecutive course modules. The results obtained from both quantitative and qualitative data are promising, showing an increase in student in-class quiz scores along with positive student engagement with the gamified quiz. Students also reported that the game made them more comfortable with asking questions. Future work would extend this research to more students and over a longer period. The LLM and gamification also have much potential, where games can be created dynamically and be customized and personalized for each student's needs. This work shows an exciting gap in research that could lead to gamified experiences for students in the flipped model that are both relevant and personalized with the use of a LLM, offering the students the greatest chance for success. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The combined approach addresses the challenges of large class sizes and fosters deeper understanding of complex engineering concepts. The problem of large student numbers is common in developing countries where there is a shortage of lecturers and facilities that do not meet training needs but have not received much research attention. Through a structured process that includes pre-class preparation, team-based activities, and focused communication with group leaders, this method promotes active learning, collaboration, and accountability among students. The study outlines the implementation of this approach in engineering courses, evaluates its effectiveness, and discusses potential benefits and challenges. The results from two Design of Experiment and Introduction to Engineering courses showed that this newly method had good effectiveness. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be applied to technology training, especially in developing countries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Contribution: This study provides an implementation of a partially flipped classroom with gamification aspects that has shown a statistically significant increase in student performance relative to traditional lecture. Background: Electronic Circuits is a challenging required course for first-year students in the Electrical Engineering degree program at National Taiwan University. Students taking the English section have historically performed lower than other Chinese sections, likely due to their diverse backgrounds and less familiarity with Taiwanese-style exams. Intended Outcome: This study applied flipped-learning-with-gamification teaching methods to evaluate their effectiveness in improving students' motivation to solve ungraded practice problems and increase student performance. One-third of the class was a condensed in-class lecture with supplemental online videos, while two-thirds was a problem-solving session with students in teams. A class gameboard (leaderboard) and weekly concept cards (badges) were used to motivate the students to complete weekly ungraded practice problems. Findings: The results showed that the flipped-learning-with-gamification approach increased the average of the English section's normalized quiz and exam grades by 11.6% compared to the previous year, such that the section's average performance matched that of the other sections (control groups). Results also found that higher grades were most strongly correlated with higher completion rates of in-class problems and were uncorrelated with lecture attendance. Survey results showed that students liked the gamification aspects of working in teams, receiving concept cards, and completing challenge problems more than the course gameboard. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Previous studies that detected learning-related emotions predominantly focused on feedback provided after learning sessions (e.g., at the end of the semester). Though this approach provides insights into students’ emotional states, it cannot support dynamic adaptability to their needs. To address this problem, we asked students to express their emotions as they arise during learning sessions. Previous studies focused on large-resource languages, such as English, and, to the best of our knowledge, none considered Serbian. We performed a case study to build Machine Learning (ML) models that can detect learning-related emotions. We asked the students to explicitly express their learning-related emotions every 20 min during their interactions with the Intelligent Tutoring System that supported pre-class activities for a blended flipped classroom software engineering course. Five annotators annotated the collected 955 instances for five emotions. We trained ML models using different text representations – BERTić, ELMO, and TF-IDF. The highest F-measure (0.75) was achieved using TF-IDF and BERTić representations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The flipped classroom allows students to learn at their own pace before coming to class, while the BITalino kit provides an affordable and versatile platform for acquiring and analyzing biosignals like electromyography (EMG). The paper details a case study where students used the BITalino kit to classify EMG signals as fatigue and non-fatigue. The methodology involved acquiring EMG signals from the quadriceps muscles during an incremental exercise test, followed by signal processing, feature extraction, and machine learning classification. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the flipped classroom and BITalino kit in enhancing student learning and engagement with biosignal processing. The developed machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 90% in classifying muscle fatigue, highlighting its potential for applications in sports science, rehabilitation, and ergonomics. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of integrating new technologies into engineering education to create immersive learning experiences and equip students with the necessary skills for the evolving demands of the industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study explores the adoption of active learning methodologies in university-level Electronic Engineering education and their relationship with student satisfaction. Through a quantitative research design, we analyzed data collected from teaching performance surveys conducted over two semesters in 2023. Initiated in 2020, these surveys assess students' satisfaction with teaching methodologies and the educational services provided. Our findings reveal a pronounced preference for interactive and applied pedagogical methods, highlighting the need for teaching strategies that align with current learning expectations and styles. A significant gap was identified between faculty competencies and student expectations, particularly within the Science and Engineering faculty of a university in Lima, which recorded the lowest scores in teaching quality, course mastery, and student-teacher rapport. These results underscore the imperative to enhance teaching competencies and align them with effective teaching methodologies to improve students' educational experience. The proposed class session model is centered around the integration of active learning methodologies selected by students, addressing areas for improvement and adaptable to various topics and course levels within the Electronic Engineering program. This model emphasizes technical knowledge and the development of soft skills and generic competencies, preparing students to be competent professionals and socially responsible individuals. For successful implementation, a sustained commitment to faculty training and adaptability to the evolving needs of students and society is essential. The integration of comprehensive projects, digital game-based learning, and micro-learning strategies for personalized and effective learning was highlighted. Continuous assessment and the development of improvement plans based on teaching competencies are crucial for tailoring education to accreditation process demands and student needs. The study also examines the impact of micro-learning on scientific research education, suggesting that presenting content in small segments significantly enhances the understanding and retention of concepts in Electronic Engineering. Moreover, it discusses the development of generic competencies such as empathy, ethics, and social responsibility, complementary to technical skills through "Knowing how to be" in Engineering and the flipped classroom methodology. The conclusion is that the adoption of active learning methodologies holds promise for enhancing educational quality in Engineering. It emphasizes a holistic approach that considers faculty training and the implementation of innovative pedagogical practices. The necessity for pedagogical innovation and continuous improvement is crucial for maintaining the relevance and effectiveness of Engineering programs, ensuring students are prepared for a constantly changing world. This work proposes a paradigm shift in university teaching, highlighting the importance of adapting educational methodologies to meet the needs of contemporary students. Future research should focus on the large-scale implementation of this model and evaluating its impact on the professional and personal preparedness of Engineering students. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The results of the model do not show a significant impact on academic results compared to the control group. Furthermore, the acceptance of the FC methodology is significantly lower than PBL due to the perception that a group of students has of themselves in the course and a deficient temporal sequence in the classes.

	abstract = {With the arrival of the era of “Internet plus”, the traditional education model has been unable to adapt to social development. Information technology and advanced teaching equipment have been continuously applied to the field of vocational education, especially micro class teaching and flipped classroom. With the help of “Internet plus”, new teaching models and methods are increasingly valued by higher vocational colleges. The purpose of this study is to explore the ecological model of blended assisted college English teaching based on “Internet plus” technology. The research question is: What impact does the use of “Internet plus” technology have on college English learning? This research will adopt a cross-sectional design, focusing on how Internet plus can help students achieve higher scores in their writing assignments. This study also aims to investigate whether there are differences in the effect of using Internet plus and traditional classroom teaching. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

First year mechanical engineering students are offered different teaching materials (mainly lecture videos, lightboard videos and micro-module lectures) to study from a distance and comprehend the principle underlying science in theory. Presence or online plenary lectures offer the opportunity to apply knowledge and transfer different scientific aspects of the course to get the bigger picture.

Over the course of three years, the course transitioned from a traditional direct-instruction format to a flipped-classroom design, resulting in positive student learning outcomes. This article covers the course design philosophy, its syllabus, learning objectives, and the incorporation of both quantitative and qualitative student feedback in shaping the course. Furthermore, the article shares the insights gleaned from our experience, which can serve as best practices for instructors aiming to deliver a successful Linear Algebra course for undergraduate students in Computer Science. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the flipped-classroom approach, with carefully created lecture videos and appropriate in-class exercises, in engaging students and enhancing their understanding of the mathematical concepts by incorporating innovative teaching methodologies and emphasizing the practical applications of Linear Algebra within the context of Computer Science education. From our study of our students' performance in their final summative assessments, we establish that their learning is enhanced using the flipped-classroom methodology. In addition, from their quantitative and qualitative feedback, we conclude that the flipped classroom fosters strong in-class engagement and overall satisfaction with the course. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Design/methodology/approach: A didactic sequence has been designed and applied with students of the University Catholique of Louvain (Belgium) in collaboration with teachers from the University of Zaragoza (also researchers in the knowledge areas of Electronics, Applied Physics and the Didactics of Experimental Sciences). Several methodologies were applied thorough the teaching-learning sequence as the flipped classroom is. A varied sample of assessment instruments was used. Findings: The results suggest this sequence produces a more significant learning than a more conventional teaching, however there is no increase in the number of students who passed. The students explaining phenomena scientifically, evaluating and designing experiments and making researchable questions and interpreting data and scientific evidence, which are a consequence of the development of scientific knowledge (content, procedural and epistemic). In addition, the students kept motivated by this methodological change and maintained the perception of having achieved the expected learning according to the objectives of the course. Originality/value: Until a few years ago, research in the didactics of experimental sciences, and the application in the classroom of the results obtained, was limited to education in non-university stages. The opportunity of this work is to expand knowledge in relation to the application of didactic strategies in physics education at a higher level. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The article presents the theoretical part of the method and also describes the process of applying the flipped classroom method: preparation, development of the lecture plan, selection of tools for working with students, and feedback from students. The SWOT analysis of the case study is conducted. The results of the study show that students positively evaluate the use of the flipped classroom. Students mentioned the following positive aspects: more practice during lectures, flexibility in time and place, permanent and active learning, the possibility to learn at their own pace, to prepare for class, and take responsibility. As negative aspects, students mentioned the following: technical problems, technological inadequacies, lack of time for lecture preparation, previous habits, no adequate video duration, and workload. But it was also a challenge for the teachers: heavy workload (preparation), use of different tools in the application of the flipped classroom, involvement, and encouragement of the students. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom is an innovative pedagogy that shifts content delivery outside the classroom, utilizing in-class time for interactive learning. The preclass and in-class activities in this framework encourage individualized learning and collaborative problem-solving among students, fostering engagement. The Innovative Flipped Learning Instruction Project (IFLIP) conducted faculty development workshops over 4 years, guiding science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty in integrating flipped teaching (FT) into their courses. The research aimed to assess its impact on pedagogical practices, explore its effectiveness, and provide a framework to implement FT across multiple institutions. It sought to evaluate the experiences of these educators throughout the transitional period of instructional change. In the fourth year of this project, a symposium was organized for IFLIP participants to share their experiences and findings concerning FT. This symposium helped promote collaboration among IFLIP participants and faculty interested in FT to disseminate participants’ knowledge and experiences in implementing FT strategies. A survey conducted at the end of the symposium indicated that faculty participants with FT experience continued to embrace this pedagogy, and the new adopters expressed intentions to incorporate it into their courses. The survey revealed positive responses: 93% of respondents plan to integrate FT methods in future classes, 90% gained new information from the symposium and intend to implement it, and 91% are likely to recommend FT to colleagues. Ultimately, the symposium underscored the transformative impact of FT in empowering educators to deepen students’ conceptual understanding, emphasizing the significance of this pedagogical approach in advancing the quality of education. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Identifying FC learning behaviors that lead to academic success remains a challenge. This paper addresses this challenge by conducting an empirical study in an undergraduate software engineering course employing the FC model. The empirical study draws on the data from an intelligent tutoring system that captured the learning traces of students performing pre-class activities. These traces provided indicators of students’ regularity of engagement, which were then matched to their final exam scores. Regression models were trained to predict final exam scores based on the regularity of engagement indicators. Students were clustered based on their regularity of engagement indicators to uncover actionable feedback for future course iterations. The case study confirms the generalizability of earlier findings that the regularity of engagement is vital for student performance and that course-specific predictors significantly impact the models’ prediction performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The scripted teaching cannot attract the students' attention. Moreover, agile development, which is common in the industry, has not yet been practiced in the classroom, resulting in a gap between industry and academia. We offered 'Drone Module Programming' and 'Agile Development' projects in management courses. Students in the class were divided into several teams based on different agile tasks. Each team was supposed to 'Develop a facial recognition drone'. We provided the drone learning materials online and implemented flipped teaching so that students could learn and practice drone programming online. In the classroom, we had meetings on project management and wrote project documents with students. By implementing this innovative teaching method, a significant difference was found in the learning outcomes of the students studying project management theory. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of educational technology, the English teaching mode in colleges and universities faces innovation challenges. As an emerging teaching mode, flipped classroom promotes students’ active learning and improves classroom efficiency by switching the order of pre-course learning and in-class activities.Seq2seq technology, as a significant application of deep learning in natural language processing, is used in flipped classroom to provide new perspectives and methods for English teaching, which is expected to stimulate students’ interest in learning and improve the quality of teaching through technological means. This study aims to examine Seq2Seq2’s ability to enhance the quality of teaching and learning. This study explores the impact of Seq2seq technology on English flipped classroom teaching in colleges and universities. Using an experimental research method, 120 first-year university students were selected as the research subjects and divided into experimental and control groups, applying Seq2seq-assisted flipped classroom teaching and traditional teaching methods respectively. The study used a pre-test and post-test design, and collected students’ English achievement and learning motivation questionnaires to analyze data. Students in the experimental group outperformed the control group in English, with a mean score increase of 6.27 points, and their motivation to learn was also improved. The students in the experimental group showed improvement in vocabulary mastery, reading comprehension, and writing ability. The study shows that applying Seq2seq technology in flipped classroom can effectively improve students’ English learning achievement and learning motivation, which is of great significance for promoting the development of English teaching in colleges and universities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Basic energy and electricity concepts are often misunderstood by first-year engineering students. One of the main reasons for this is that these concepts are perceived as abstract, making it challenging for students to relate them to real-life situations. Experimental laboratories are designed to help students delve deeper into these concepts. However, the demand for more visual aids by students, coupled with their limited ability to grasp complex ideas, often leads to the perception that some labs are outdated and reinforces misconceptions. To address this issue, this article introduces a novel laboratory workbench and methodology aimed at enhancing basic electrical energy and instrumentation laboratory sessions. The approach utilizes a more visual and interactive platform that enables students to connect electrical concepts with real-life elements. Prior to attending the class, students watch instructional videos that demonstrate the practical procedures, following the Flipped Learning strategy. The results of this study reveal that students felt more confident during the laboratory sessions and exhibited a more active attitude, actively asking questions and defending their viewpoints. Professors also observed that time was utilized more effectively, allowing for a better understanding of topics and clarification of confusing content. Overall, the proposed lab sessions significantly improve the learning experience of first-year Physics students and foster their autonomy in learning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the adoption of flipped learning as an educational approach has gained significant momentum. This pedagogical method involves the delivery of direct instruction outside of the classroom, utilising videos, quizzes and lecture slides to facilitate active learning during class time. To address the challenge of student motivation and enhance overall engagement, the incorporation of game-based learning within the flipped learning approach has emerged as a promising solution. This research aims to explore the potential of gaming in promoting active learning and fostering a deeper understanding of course material. The findings highlight the positive impact of gamification on student engagement and academic performance within an undergraduate Engineering module. Through the integration of game elements, such as Kahoot and a leader board system, students exhibited increased motivation and active participation throughout the course. The implementation of game-based strategies effectively captured students’ attention and facilitated a dynamic learning environment. The results demonstrated a positive correlation between engagement levels and academic performance, affirming the efficacy of gamification in promoting enhanced learning outcomes. Furthermore, this study highlighted the importance of recognising and celebrating student achievements through public displays of accomplishment. The public acknowledgement of high achievers not only instilled a sense of pride and motivation in these students but also inspired their peers to strive for excellence. The collective applause and recognition from the entire class served as a powerful reinforcement of the value and significance of active engagement in the module. These findings emphasise the potential of integrating flipped learning and game-based strategies as a comprehensive educational framework that caters to diverse student needs and maximises learning outcomes. Future research will focus on scaling up the study to encompass a wider range of undergraduate Engineering modules, involving a larger cohort of students from various disciplines. By expanding the investigation, a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of gamification on different student populations can be attained. Overall, this study contributes to the growing body of literature on gamification in education, underscores its potential to transform traditional instructional practices and promotes effective teaching and learning experiences. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Previous research has concluded that, when implemented well, flipped learning has the potential not only to increase learning gain but also to improve students’ professional skills such as teamwork, communication, and life-long learning, which are deemed to be critical in engineering education and practice. This study aimed to examine the development of teamwork skills in a flipped civil engineering course. A sequential mixed-method approach was adopted to understand students’ attitude toward teamwork, confidence in teamwork, and teamwork skill development. Quantitative data included pre- and postcourse surveys and peer evaluation (PE) and self-evaluation (SE) while qualitative data included focus group interviews. Results indicated that students’ attitudes toward teamwork slightly improved, but it was not statistically significant. Confidence in teamwork, however, significantly improved after being engaged in a semester-long team project. Teamwork skill development was assessed through four PE and SE conducted after each major project milestone. Findings are discussed and implications for classroom implementations and future research are presented. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The participants were 61 undergraduate students of railway engineering at Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), who were divided into integrated flipped, conventional flipped, and traditional non-flipped groups. For the integrated flipped group, the inquiry-based learning was conducted in terms of five phases of orientation, conceptualization, investigation, data interpretation, and conclusion. They also used Edmodo and Google Docs as the two collaborative platforms for promoting writing skills. The conventional group only watched the instructional videos before the class, while for the traditional group neither the instructional videos nor the technological tools were used for improving their writing skills. The results of ANOVA revealed significant differences among the three groups in that learners in the integrated flipped group significantly outperformed those in the other groups, particularly in terms of the components of grammar and fluency. In addition, this approach made the learners more engaged, motivated, satisfied, and less anxious. The results also showed learners’ positive attitudes toward the pedagogical values of Edmodo and Google Docs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Professors who teach classes in technical building schools are aware of the changes that are taking place in engineering or architecture, such as the implementation of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology and new construction technologies. Focus on courses of building materials; currently it is not useful knowing the different existing materials but to work in the field of needs, properties, and interpretation of the regulations. Once the flipped classroom methodology was introduced in the subject, it was possible to involve the students more, since practical cases were solved during the classes. Over time, we realized that students became more engaged if they found a practical use for what they were learning. So, we started implementing another learning strategy, challenge-based learning (CBL). The objective is for students to become prescribers with the necessary knowledge to determine which materials are the best for projects that the chosen materials are suitable for placement in a work, and if these were replaced by similar ones, also new materials would comply with properties and characteristics of the project. The course is presented as a large project in which students decide the materials with which the building will be built. To do this, they are provided with fundamental knowledge about what is important when choosing a material, and they are taught to handle current technical and regulatory information on materials. At the end of the experience, the students took a survey to find out how it went; this way, professors had feedback to improve in future courses. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study proposes a two-stage classification approach to predict students' performance in a flipped classroom approach, using data from Moodle LMS, organized according to the Revised Bloom's Taxonomy and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning. The approach involves classifying students as Pass or Fail in the first stage, and then further classifying Pass students into A, B, or C grades in the second stage. The findings indicate that applying the two-stage approach with the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) outperforms the one-stage approach for addressing the issue of multi-class imbalanced learning. Various supervised machine learning techniques were evaluated, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), with GBT achieving the highest performance overall. KNN also showed the most significant improvement from the traditional one-stage to the two-stage classification. This method enhances the accuracy of identifying at-risk students and predicting their final grades, which enhances early warning systems and personalized learning interventions in flipped classrooms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This research-based full paper focuses on building confidence and inclusion for women engineering students by implementing various modes of learning (e.g., an interactive online textbook, Pre-recorded Lecture Videos (PLVs), and equally gendered-ratio teams for in-class team worksheets and course project) into a sophomore-level engineering course. It has been recognized that lack of inclusion has been linked to negative outcomes in student performance, specifically for women. As men dominate most engineering majors, it has been seen that women students find it hard to participate in group work settings. When working in groups, women students have experienced gender biases that were demeaning and often have their ideas or designs second-guessed. These feelings of self-doubt and lack of involvement, repeated over time, led many women students to leave engineering. It is hypothesized that by providing many learning opportunities outside the classroom that positively reinforce their knowledge and understanding and by balancing the gender ratio of teams, women will be more confident in their abilities and feel more included, respectively. Confidence plays a deciding factor in the retention rates of women within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields of study. Anecdotally, it was discovered that during the development and implementation of an interactive online textbook and using PLVs, many women within the introductory Statics and Mechanics of Materials 1 course felt something unfamiliar compared to other STEM courses: confidence. Confidence is a prime indicator of successful completion of a program. To further explore this finding, a study involving focus groups was conducted with three assemblages of women within the course. Two focus groups discussed using the interactive online textbook (n=8 and n = 9), while one discussed using PLVs (n=8). These focus groups were moderated by two women, a Ph.D. student in Physics and a current Mechanical Engineering undergraduate student. The focus groups were recorded using the University's approved video recording platform (Panopto) and transcribed using NVivo, being corrected and verified by researchers. Various themes were found, with one indicating that women felt more confident about their abilities and knowledge when engaging with the interactive online textbook than when using traditional educational methods. Interestingly, using the textbook and PLVs also helped women feel more confident going into and asking questions in the classroom. Another finding was that the women viewed the equally gendered structuring of groups for in-class team worksheets and projects as a very positive action. The findings of this study set up future work scrutinizing which mechanisms not only promote confidence but a sense of belonging for women within engineering and, hopefully, other fields within STEM. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Contribution: This work-in-progress innovative practice paper presents the inception of an undergraduate course focusing on the Ensemble of Countermeasures for Malicious Thermal Sensors Attacks (ECMTA), representing a novel endeavor at this academic level. Rooted in prior research across academic and industrial domains, this ongoing initiative embodies a journey of exploration and discovery in an emerging field, awaiting feedback from students and our industrial advisory board. Additionally, this proposal advocates for a flipped classroom (FC) model, prioritizing pre-class materials for theoretical understanding and in-class sessions for practical application and collaboration. Simultaneously, this project is an ongoing investigation into the effectiveness of FC methodologies for Hispanic/Latino populations in cybersecurity education. Recognizing the current dearth of consensus in the literature regarding this demographic's response to FC, the project aims to address this gap through a comprehensive assessment of Hispanic/Latino students' attitudes and academic outcomes, with findings expected by the end of 2024. Background: The surge in IoT devices revolutionized industries, offering convenience and connectivity. Yet, they pose substantial cybersecurity challenges, notably in thermal sensor vulnerabilities. Attackers' exploitation of these sensors to manipulate the temperatures of IOT devices underscores the urgent necessity for robust cybersecurity in IoT ecosystems. Intended outcome: This course's intended outcome is multifaceted. Students will grasp thermal sensor vulnerabilities and learn varied countermeasures to mitigate risks. Practical skills will be honed through hands-on lab exercises and simulations. Additionally, they'll foster a mindset of continual learning, which is vital for evolving cybersecurity careers. Following this study, we aim to assess the effectiveness of flipped classroom methodologies for Hispanic/Latino populations in cybersecurity education. Application Design: The course offers theoretical lectures, practical workshops, research projects, and assessments focused on defending against thermal sensor attacks. It integrates cybersecurity into undergraduate curricula, fostering innovative teaching methods. Ultimately, it aims to prepare a new generation of cybersecurity professionals for security challenges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This research-to-practice full paper describes an experimental study investigating the benefits of note-taking to enhance pre-class content learning in a flipped classroom (FC) environment applied to an Engineering Physics course. In an FC, fundamental content learning occurs before the class (targeting low cognitive levels on Bloom's taxonomy), allowing in-class time to reinforce and apply concepts (addressing high cognitive levels on Bloom's taxonomy). However, there is a lack of empirical and controlled research studies investigating optimal strategies for obtaining high-value pre-class content learning. This study aims to contribute to this matter. Four groups are considered, each comprising an average of 40 students, following the FC instructional methodology. Pre-class activities precede the class, including reading prepared documents and watching prepared videos. In-class assessments consist of a brief multiple-choice test (maximum of 5 questions) related to the pre-class activities, aiming to evaluate low cognitive levels on Bloom's taxonomy. To enhance note-taking practices, students are encouraged to take notes, and at the beginning of the course, a video showcasing five note-taking strategies is provided. The experiment carried out along one of the chapters revised in the Engineering Physics course includes one control group and one experimental group. In the control group, students are encouraged to take notes without additional guidance, whereas in the experimental group, students receive a fill-in-the-blank style note- taking guide. The results indicate that students who engage in note-taking, irrespective of the strategy used, outperform those who do not take notes. It is well-documented that note-taking produces an improvement in the in-class learning process. Here, we show how this benefit can be translated to activities before class, enhancing self-regulation learning and reducing the cognitive load during in-class note-taking. Regarding the note-taking guide, there is no significant evidence to support the improvement of student performance. This lack of progress may be attributed to the nature of the guide, using a linear note-taking strategy that ends with non-generative notes. This study shows the benefits of note-taking in enhancing pre-class content learning in an FC environment applied to an Engineering Physics course and invites us to rethink how the note-taking guide structure could encourage the production of generative notes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Pedagogical innovation is one of the constant challenges in Higher Education because it combines frameworks of educational systems, adaptation to society's changes and needs for employment, curricula, technological transformations and recent trends in research in the area of education and pedagogy. This article aims toanalyze the challenges of pedagogical and technological innovation and present the flipped classroom model as one of the successful strategies in current pedagogy, namely in Higher Education. Nowadays, in active learning, the studenttakes on a more active mission, in which he solves problems, develops projects and creates opportunities for the construction of knowledge. This concept has been promoted through several strategies using research, gamification, Problem Based Learning (PBL) and the "flipped classroom"concept, which MIT and Harvard have used and deeply researched. These universities have explored innovation and educational technologies, with a focus on the student, who studies before class, making the classroom an active learning space, with practical activities, accompanied by theteacher, who now has a new mission, different from the traditional content presentation. Therefore, the theoretical basis of the article is focused on pedagogical and technological innovation, active methodologies and the strategy of the "flipped classroom". The coronavirus pandemic has turned the world upside down and made us take a fresh look at innovative blended learning technologies and, in particular, flipped classroom technology. The article discusses theprinciples on which the learning process in the "flipped classroom"model should be based. The platforms and services that provide the most effective transfer of materials to students for study and are maximally focused on the independentwork of students are discussed. The indicators of adaptation of students to the conditions of blended learning are analyzed (actual results of educational activities; degree of student satisfaction with the results of their educational activities; self-assessment of readiness to use remote learning technologies in the educational process; formation of skills and abilities of independent work and self-organization). © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the flipped-classroom methodology in a virtual teaching context-prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic-in the instruction of Chemistry, as compared to the traditional approach. On the one hand, students following the flipped-classroom methodology (Bachelor s Degree in Agri-environmental Engineering) were required to review materials prepared for this purpose prior to the sessions, devoting the class time to address queries and engage in exercises. On the other hand, students the traditional method (Bachelor s Degree in Agricultural Engineering) attended on-line lectures and exercise sessions. The study assessed whether the implementation of the flipped-classroom methodology enhanced students' learning and their participation in the subject, investigating the influence of the methodologies on assessment grades and student appraisals.The findings indicated that the flipped-classroom approach reduced procrastination and increased student engagement in attending classes and completing activities. Nevertheless, a high rate of absenteeism was observed under virtual learning conditions, irrespective of the teaching method followed. Students expressed contentment with the flipped classroom activities, highlighting that it facilitated individualized learning and accommodated their learning pace. Negative feedback revolved around the lack of real-Time interaction for query resolution in the asynchronous phase, as opposed to lecture-based classes where questions can be immediately addressed. While no discernible differences in grades between methodologies were observed, the flipped-classroom approach proved satisfactory, warranting its expanded use in subsequent courses following necessary improvements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study investigated the implementation and student outcomes of early adopters of the flipped classroom approach. We used the Diffusion of Innovations framework to compare the implementation and outcomes in traditional and flipped courses of five early adopters of the flipped classroom approach. Data included classroom observations, student grades, and student evaluations of teaching. Results indicated that students in flipped courses spent less class time listening to lectures and more time engaged in active learning during class than did students in traditional courses. However, these changes in instruction did not result in significantly improved student performance or student evaluations of teaching. These results demonstrate the positive outcomes frequently observed in previous studies may take more time to replicate in early adopters’ courses. This work reinforces the need to continue studying the implementation and outcomes of educational innovations throughout their adoption. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The ‘flipped classroom’ approach is an innovative approach in educational delivery systems. In a typical flipped class model, work that is typically done as homework in the didactic model is interactively undertaken in the class with the guidance of the teacher, whereas listening to a lecture or watching course-related videos is undertaken at home. The essence of a flipped classroom is that the activities carried out during traditional class time and self-study time are reversed or ‘flipped’. Objectives: The primary objectives of this review were to assess the effectiveness of the flipped classroom intervention for undergraduate health professional students on their academic performance, and their course satisfaction. Search Methods: We identified relevant studies by searching MEDLINE (Ovid), APA PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) as well as several more electronic databases, registries, search engines, websites, and online directories. The last search update was performed in April 2022. Selection Criteria: Included studies had to meet the following criteria: Participants: Undergraduate health professional students, regardless of the type of healthcare streams (e.g., medicine, pharmacy), duration of the learning activity, or the country of study. Intervention: We included any educational intervention that included the flipped classroom as a teaching and learning tool in undergraduate programs, regardless of the type of healthcare streams (e.g., medicine, pharmacy). We also included studies that aimed to improve student learning and/or student satisfaction if they included the flipped classroom for undergraduate students. We excluded studies on standard lectures and subsequent tutorial formats. We also excluded studies on flipped classroom methods, which did not belong to the health professional education(HPE) sector (e.g., engineering, economics). Outcomes: The included studies used primary outcomes such as academic performance as judged by final examination grades/scores or other formal assessment methods at the immediate post-test, as well as student satisfaction with the method of learning. Study design: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies (QES), and two-group comparison designs. Although we had planned to include cluster-level RCTs, natural experiments, and regression discontinuity designs, these were not available. We did not include qualitative research. Data Collection and Analysis: Two members of the review team independently screened the search results to assess articles for their eligibility for inclusion. The screening involved an initial screening of the title and abstracts, and subsequently, the full text of selected articles. Discrepancies between the two investigators were settled through discussion or consultation with a third author. Two members of the review team then extracted the descriptions and data from the included studies. Main Results: We found 5873 potentially relevant records, of which we screened 118 of them in full text, and included 45 studies (11 RCTs, 19 QES, and 15 two-group observational studies) that met the inclusion criteria. Some studies assessed more than one outcome. We included 44 studies on academic performance and eight studies on students' satisfaction outcomes in the meta-analysis. The main reasons for excluding studies were that they had not implemented a flipped class approach or the participants were not undergraduate students in health professional education. A total of 8426 undergraduate students were included in 45 studies that were identified for this analysis. The majority of the studies were conducted by students from medical schools (53.3%, 24/45), nursing schools (17.8%, 8/45), pharmacy schools (15.6%, 7/45). medical, nursing, and dentistry schools (2.2%, 1/45), and other health professional education programs (11.1%, 5/45). Among these 45 studies identified, 16 (35.6%) were conducted in the United States, six studies in China, four studies in Taiwan, three in India, two studies each in Australia and Canada, followed by nine single studies from Brazil, German, Iran, Norway, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Based on overall average effect sizes, there was better academic performance in the flipped class method of learning compared to traditional class learning (standardised mean difference [SMD] = 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25 to 0.90, τ<sup>2</sup>: 1.16; I<sup>2</sup>: 98%; p < 0.00001, 44 studies, n = 7813). In a sensitivity analysis that excluded eleven studies with imputed data from the original analysis of 44 studies, academic performance in the flipped class method of learning was better than traditional class learning (SMD = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.24 to 0.85, τ<sup>2</sup>: 0.76; I<sup>2</sup>: 97%; p < 0.00001, 33 studies, n = 5924); all being low certainty of evidence. Overall, student satisfaction with flipped class learning was positive compared to traditional class learning (SMD = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.15 to 0.82, τ<sup>2</sup>: 0.19, I<sup>2</sup>:89%, p < 0.00001, 8 studies n = 1696); all being low certainty of evidence. Authors' Conclusions: In this review, we aimed to find evidence of the flipped classroom intervention's effectiveness for undergraduate health professional students. We found only a few RCTs, and the risk of bias in the included non-randomised studies was high. Overall, implementing flipped classes may improve academic performance, and may support student satisfaction in undergraduate health professional programs. However, the certainty of evidence was low for both academic performance and students' satisfaction with the flipped method of learning compared to the traditional class learning. Future well-designed sufficiently powered RCTs with low risk of bias that report according to the CONSORT guidelines are needed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study presents an improved hybrid-flipped classroom (hybrid-FC) education method based on technology-enhanced learning (TEL) along with diluted classes for a course on probability and random processes in engineering. The proposed system was imple-mented with the participation of two student groups who alternated weekly between attending face-to-face activities and fully online classes as a sanitary measure during the pandemic. The education model was combined with the flipped classroom (FC) approach in order to improve the quality of learning and address the negative effects of remote education. Before the lessons, the students studied the course material, filled a question form, and then took a low-stake online quiz. Then, the students attended a session where the questions reported in the forms were discussed, and they took an online problem-solving session followed by an individual quiz. Class sessions were available to both online and face-to-face students, as well as in the form of video recordings for anyone who missed lessons. Qualitatively and quantitatively, the proposed education method proved to be more effective and comprehensive than conventional online methodologies. The students' performances were evaluated via quizzes and exams measuring the achievement of the course learning outcomes (CLOs). Weekly pre/post-tests were applied to examine the students’ progress in each topic. Midterm and final exams were planned to measure the level of success for all course topics. Additionally, the students' perception was assessed with questionnaires and face-to-face interviews. A performance assessment showed an apparent increase in the success rate, and the students' perception was found to be positive. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Protein Engineering is a core compulsory course of biotechnology major, which is the first-class undergraduate major being constructed in Shanxi Province. In view of the problems of single teaching mode of Protein Engineering, such as insufficient students’ participation, short teaching time, and expensive experiment cost, the course team carried out the reform and practice of teaching mode for this course, and put forward a new teaching strategy. Under the guidance of the “Golden Course” standard for advancement, innovation and challenge, the course team developed the materials for massive open online courses (MOOC), and carried out the online and offline mixed teaching of Protein Engineering based on BOPPPS+flipped classroom by using the Chao-Xing Fan-Ya network teaching platform. Through this, a comprehensive, systematic and dynamic new teaching system of Protein Engineering was developed. Using the teaching mode based on BOPPPS+flipped classroom, the offline classroom teaching was combined with students’ online self-study and homework completion, chapter test and discussion, and this mixed teaching mode was fully integrated into the flipped classroom. After three rounds of teaching practice, the course team had developed a complete, reproducible, scientific and reasonable online and offline mixed teaching mode, which included course materials preparation, exploring experiment guidance, classroom discussion design and course performance evaluation. The online and offline mixed teaching mode of Protein Engineering based on BOPPPS+flipped classroom was helpful for students to improve their autonomous learning ability, to be deeply engaged in the whole teaching process, and to develop a comprehensive and profound understanding of Protein Engineering. This teaching mode improved the teaching quality of Protein Engineering, and facilitated students to learn other follow-up professional courses. Moreover, it provides a reference for the course teaching reform. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Before the COVID-19 SARS-COV pandemic of 2020, significant momentum had occurred in the engineering education community for use of flipped classrooms. For engineering educators seeking to develop more time and space in the classroom for active learning activities, flipped classrooms are an attractive pedagogical tool. The concept of a flipped classroom is to provide students with a pre-class video viewing and pre-class reading assignment to prime them for in-class interactive learning experiences. The engineering education literature has many positive examples of flipped classrooms. In our curricula, flipped classrooms were used to positive effect in geotechnical engineering courses within the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering for several years, with student learning outcomes and student opinion surveys used to document the effectiveness and reception of the flipped classroom format. However, the COVID-19 pandemic provided a 2-year change in student learning unprecedented in recent memory. Instruction for much of the undergraduate curricula went online to at least some extent during the pandemic. Although there was a range of virtual learning tools used to varying effect over the pandemic, with different approaches utilized by faculty, students found themselves in a virtual environment for an extended period. In the aftermath of the pandemic, engineering educators have observed a markedly changed student reception of the flipped classroom concept. Despite not changing the tools and techniques utilized in the same classes pre- and post-pandemic, student reception of the flipped classroom format has decreased. Data collected from flipped classrooms post-pandemic are compared in this paper to data collected pre-pandemic. The results of this comparison of student feedback and learning outcomes has shown that the effects of the pandemic induced virtual campus experience has changed the landscape, perhaps just temporarily, and that students' post-pandemic are overwhelmingly desirous of in-class instruction with no videos. They are tired of videos and online modules! They want to interact face-to-face. This paper helps provide a balanced examination of the times and seasons for effective use of the flipped classroom format. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A flipped classroom is no longer a novel idea, but engineering education has lagged in implementing this non-traditional course delivery method. Traditional engineering courses are typically offered in an instructor-centered environment which impacts everything from content delivery to student engagement and learning. A decade ago, we initiated a major project in curriculum reform that included flipping three second-year civil engineering courses: Statics, Dynamics, and Deformable Solids. These courses are foundational for all civil engineering students but, up to that point, had only been offered using traditional textbooks and lecture-based instruction. Flipping the classroom was driven by a desire to acknowledge what is known about active learning to push the courses to better fit today's engineering needs. The result of flipping the classroom had an effect far beyond simply switching the use of the student's time inside and outside of class. The traditional approach to course delivery falls short on engaging the students and in understanding where students struggle and what they know. To address the first two issues, the flipped classroom approach was selected and executed across all three courses. Implementation required adjustments at the university level to course scheduling, including finding classroom spaces suitable for group work. The schedule and workflows of each individual course were redesigned. The majority of class time was reserved for recitation periods where students work on problems in groups with the help of an instructional team. While we initially held one lecture per two-week module, eventually all reading, lecture, and passive activities were moved outside of class time. Establishing the class time as the place to do the work and emphasize problem solving strategies improved student's time on task and reinforced the main learning goals of each course. This paper will layout the logistics of flipping these courses along with the changes made to the content. The redesign process offered an opportunity to rethink what content was important, what students could do, and the skills that the students should have at the end of each course. The material from the traditional lectures had to be condensed down to include only the main ideas of a topic that could fit in a video lecture ranging between 10 to 30 minutes, but the problem selection became much more critical to highlight the details of each topic. The alignment of the course environment with the learning goals was instrumental, and included the condensed lecture content, better problem selection, improved assessment strategies, enhanced student engagement, and more direct individualized instruction for all students. The flipped classroom has provided significantly more facetime with each student to understand and address their misconceptions and to fill in gaps in their background knowledge. We have also developed a mastery-based grading strategy that not only improves on traditional assessment strategies but also complements the learning environment by helping to direct student effort and motivation. The overall student experience has improved, and the new learning environment provides more flexibility for both the instructor and the student to achieve the learning goals of the classes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This work in progress paper looks at different first year engineering (FYE) program models and pedagogical techniques to apply to an introduction to engineering technology course. The goal is to better prepare students for college and increase freshman success. Student success will be defined in this paper by freshman retention rates, student feedback, increased upper-level course and course learning outcome comprehension. In the fall of 2022, the course included three of the six offered technology disciplines. The course was being taught by assigning readings, in-class activities, homework, and a project assigned halfway through the semester. The setup of the course led to two distinct eight-week courses being combined into one. The first part attempted to address the heterogeneity of math capabilities which ranged from remedial math to calculus II, while the second part attempted to teach engineering technology fundamentals and Microsoft competency. It was observed that students in higher-level math courses became disinterested, while lower-level math students struggled to grasp concepts. Freshman success activities had been incorporated but were insufficient as many students struggled with completing assignments. Most students were competent in using Microsoft products but struggled with accessing resources outside of class. Finally, students were eager to start projects and solve engineering problems but lacked understanding on how to apply the fundamentals to do so. In the future, FYE program models and pedagogies will be applied. In the first iteration, a flipped classroom approach with project-based learning will be applied to the course. The course will be broken into three or four modules with a project per module. The structure will have fundamentals presented in a prerecorded lecture, and problems with experiments will be assigned to further develop engineering tools in class. This will give the students the next set of tools they need to solve the project for that given module. In addition, the first weeks of the semester will serve as onboarding to college, with freshman success workshops and career development activities continually being incorporated. The hypothesis is that this approach will take the course from a refresher course to a true introduction to engineering technology. It is anticipated that a higher-level math student will stay engaged through the projects, and the application of teams will enable them to assist lower-level math students in learning fundamental concepts. The scaffolded approach of breaking the modules down into weekly parts will systematically teach students how to apply concepts to solve complex problems. It is hoped that by incorporating student feedback into the freshman success and career development activities there will be a growing sense of ownership in their engineering technology community and education. FYE models and pedagogical techniques will be evaluated and modified for engineering technology students leading into the next iteration of the course. The course will continually be iterated and eventually will incorporate all technology majors transforming the one semester refresher course into a first-year engineering technology program. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This complete research paper will present a model for offering students flexibility in assignment deadlines and the practical ramifications of enabling that flexibility on student performance in the course. Background - It is generally acknowledged that students benefit from reviewing feedback and revising their work. It's also widely recognized that this kind of iteration is logistically difficult to implement and rarely occurs in engineering courses. Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the structure of a first-year Introduction to Graphical Communications course that provided deadline flexibility and the effects that flexibility had on students iterating on their work. The course was taught at a medium-sized, private, Business+STEM-only institution in the southeast United States. Design/Method - The course was designed using the ILEARN flipped-classroom framework. The ILEARN framework divides course content into six components. (I)ntroduction lists the learning objectives of that module. (L)essons are theory-focused passive content with comprehension quizzes at the end. (E)mulates are worked examples with a think-aloud protocol where students are required to submit the emulated problem solution. (A)ctivities are akin to traditional homework assignments; new problems that can be solved using the tools and techniques demonstrated in the Lesson and Emulate tasks. (R)eflections are meta-cognitive reflection surveys. (N)ext Steps are an application of the content toward their final project. Out-of-class instruction is contained across the Lesson and Emulate tasks. In-class time is now spent in one-on-one or small group consultation to answer questions and help students move forward through the content. The flipped nature of the course enabled a more flexible deadline policy and removed the requirement for content lockstep. All assignments were given a recommended due date throughout the week. A hard deadline for each module was set 2 weeks after the Next Steps task's recommended due date. There was no grade penalty for submitting in this two-week window, but multiple nudges were in place to encourage students to submit their assignments by the recommended due date. Most notably, this 2-week buffer often enabled graders to provide feedback on work submitted on time and for students to revise and resubmit their work. Results - On 50 unique tasks assigned to 90 students, there were 4352 total assignment submissions. Students averaged 1.05 submissions per task. The maximum number of resubmissions was 4 attempts. 56 of the students resubmitted at least one task throughout the semester. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This evidence-based paper describes the process of implementing and evaluating a flipped classroom approach, in conjunction with a project-based learning methodology, in a remote Cornerstone Engineering course and how it was kept in the face-to-face return. In the first year, cornerstone engineering courses are taught mainly using project-based learning. This methodology allows students to develop teamwork and communication skills and promotes critical thinking allowing students to solve real-world problems. Traditionally, project-based learning courses are taught face-to-face. Due to COVID-19, educational institutions were forced to move from face-to-face teaching to remote teaching and learning. In this new setting, enhancing online teamwork became a challenge. In order to promote teamwork, a flipped classroom methodology with project-based learning was introduced into a Cornerstone Course during the lockdown in 2020. The flipped classroom is a teaching methodology where students learn the concepts before class meetings. In the classroom, the students apply the concepts learned asynchronously. This methodology allows students to take responsibility for their learning and to interact with their peers during classroom hours. It also allows professors to have a more productive time with students. In 2022, educational institutions returned to face-to-face teaching; this course was no exception. The teaching team maintained the flipped classroom methodology with project-based learning face-to-face. A survey was conducted to understand the students' perceptions concerning this methodology. The survey took place at the middle and end of the semester in conjunction with a small discussion group once the semester finished. The student body values the activities in class, where collaboration and teamwork are encouraged. However, they perceive an additional burden by having to watch videos before class. This article contributes to Engineering Education by providing guidelines for implementing a flipped classroom in a Cornerstone project-based learning (PBL) course. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {At the Tecnologico de Monterrey, we face two great challenges: working under a new student-centered educational model, which focuses on the development of skills and competencies; and on the other hand, the return to face-to-face learning after preventive isolation to which we were subjected due to the Covid-19 contingency. In the classrooms we observed problems in the teaching-learning process such as lack of attention, difficulty concentrating and adaptation problems. This study is an evidence-based practice that assesses the impact of the flipped classroom methodology in the Static Equilibrium Analysis course from the engineering program. The study was conducted for 10 weeks, split in two periods of 5 weeks each. A control group that worked the first period with traditional classes and the second period with the flipped classroom methodology. The second group worked with the flipped classroom methodology during the two 5-week periods. At the end of the 10 weeks of analysis, both groups presented an argumentative evaluation. The results of this study show that flipped classroom has a significant impact on the development of argumentative skills. However, when analyzing academic performance of both groups, the evaluations show that this methodology did not have a significant impact. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The School of Engineering offers several degree programs across several formats, including one conducted online for working students. It is particularly important to these students to find a productive and efficient way to incorporate the theoretical content of their courses weekly. In turn, it is necessary for educational strategies to enable students to take advantage of such content in line with their capabilities and realities and, thus, help them to arrive fully prepared for hands-on learning activities in the digital classroom. The present study measures the perceptions of a group of such students on the effectiveness of flipped classroom videos designed to introduce theoretical content related to electricity and magnetism. It involves flipped classroom videos being made available, with restricted access, as part of an electricity and magnetism course in an evening undergraduate program for adult learners at a private Chilean university. The number of videos and the time students took to watch them were individually tracked through a learning management system. Subsequently, students completed a perception survey on this flipped classroom strategy and where they were asked to compare the approach to the traditional model of receiving face-to-face lectures before each class. A cross-variable analysis was then conducted to establish student perceptions precisely and accurately. This analysis yielded results on the suitability of the material generated and the applicability of flipped classroom videos in this context. Results show that using flipped classroom videos is a viable alternative for teaching physics content in an e-learning context with adult learners. The study concludes with several recommendations regarding possible improvements for future research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the flipped classroom has emerged as an increasingly popular teaching method in higher education, as it is seen as an effective way to promote active learning among students. Nevertheless, a crucial factor that has not been studied in-depth is students' preference for the length of videos in the flipped classroom. Although a few studies have considered the design process of videos and students' preferences for video length in a flipped classroom, there are varying recommendations and a lack of data-driven analysis on how many and how long the videos should be. In this study, we investigated students' preference for video length in flipped machine learning classes offered during the spring and fall semesters of 2022. The flipped modules of this course include video lectures that vary in length, ranging from 4 to 20 minutes. Depending on the video's length, we required students to finish between three to seven video lessons before class time. To analyze student interaction with videos of different lengths, we statistically analyzed the video coverage from different modules and used surveys to gather students' preferences for video length. Our analysis indicated that the number of students completing videos before class time significantly decreased as video duration increased. However, once students started a video, they completed most of it irrespective of its length. Statistical analysis of homework scores did not show any significant difference in students' performance in modules with short videos compared to those with long videos. In response to the survey, a considerable percentage of students indicated their preference for short videos, as it helped them maintain focus. However, a higher percentage of students acknowledged that despite the varied video durations, the lengths were suitable for the presented topics. This suggests that relatively longer videos could be acceptable if the nature of the topic requires it. However, these videos should be interactive to help maintain students' attention. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we preliminarily examine the notion of the “surroundings” in an engineering classroom. We posed an open-ended reflection question to engineering undergraduates at a large US university about their classroom surroundings and its impact on their learning and comprehension. The reflection prompt defined surroundings as the “conditions and objects that surround you.” This reflection question was part of an NSF-funded study on the use of weekly reflection in a flipped fluid mechanics course to drive metacognitive development and lifelong learning skills. During class, students were encouraged to collaborate with their peers during problem solving to achieve collective understanding and interact with the instructor. Based on an inductive, emergent content analysis of the reflection data with two analysts, we obtained an unexpected result. Specifically, the most-frequently mentioned positive classroom “surroundings” was “peers” (46% of responses). We had initially expected less-positive responses related to the physical surroundings, such as classroom layout, size, furniture, infrastructure, etc. Although students identified the classroom's physical attributes as surroundings that had both negative and positive influences on their learning, a second unexpected positive response emerged with the instructor and in-person instruction as part of the “surroundings.” Upon searching the literature to understand these results, we adopted the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework. This model consists of three interacting components of cognitive presence, social presence, and teaching presence, which enable educational experiences and learning. When combined, the Community of Inquiry elements (i.e., peers, instructor, and in-class instruction) were discussed in 55% of the reflections as positive “surroundings.” Within the classroom ecosystem, feelings about positive CoI “surroundings” balanced 54% of respondents who discussed the physical room attributes as non-supportive to learning. Interestingly, when students identified their CoI as a type of surrounding, they less-frequently identified physical attributes of the classroom as non-supportive. Thus, the presence of a Community of Inquiry may have diminished the perception or impact of physical room features. Overall, our results preliminarily suggest the positive influence that an interactive flipped classroom structure can have on students' perceptions of their "surroundings". © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {From passive instruction to highly collaborative active learning, students' success in the classroom varies based on a variety of factors. With different possible learning constructs, how the classroom environment, or climate, is structured can make a significant impact on student success. When developing or adopting new pedagogical approaches, both faculty and student perspectives need to be better understood. To help fill the gaps in active learning knowledge from a student perspective, this research looked at different active learning classroom environments by assessing them with the established College and University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI). The focus of this paper centers on a single instructor that has flipped then added active learning techniques across a steel design class and a computer modeling class. To see if, and to what extent, active learning impacts the classroom climate, data from before and after active learning were compared. As part of this, CUCEI compares climates based on seven psychosocial dimensions: personalization, involvement, student cohesiveness, satisfaction, task orientation, innovation, and individualization. This paper examines: 1) how climates change between traditional and active delivery, 2) does the quantity of active learning change the climate, and lastly, 3) is there a relationship between climate and student achievement. Results show that climate perspectives do not necessarily increase or could possibly decrease when active learning is deployed. While much of the data was inconclusive, due to small sample sizes and a lack of statistical evidence, there were several observed trends that provide rich insights for educators. First, the steel course had several unique instances compared to the modeling class. In steel design, four psychosocial dimensions can best predict grades while for computer modeling only two psychosocial dimensions predict grades. Additionally for steel design, the most important climate characteristics for success are: students enjoy going class; students know exactly what has to be done; and faculty letting students decide some of the success metrics. As for computer modeling, key climate factors include: the level of in class instructor real-time support and instructors giving ample opportunity for students to pursue their class interests. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the contrasting effects of an outside-the-classroom format and an inside-the-classroom assessment format of an interactive nonlinear storytelling and 3D simulation-based learning game module. The pedagogical approach of integrating relatable story narratives within realistic simulation environments has shown to be an effective method for students to apply knowledge learned in a traditional classroom setting. Based on the findings of previous work, such applications encourage critical thinking beyond the classroom which better prepares students for their futures in the industry since most careers require increased application-based and critical thinking. For this experiment, two groups of students were introduced to the same nonlinear storytelling and simulation-based learning game module to assess their knowledge of inventory policies and queueing models. One group completed the assignment outside the classroom through a “flipped classroom” format, which was self-paced with no restriction on reference materials or time. In contrast, the second group completed the assignment inside the classroom as an assessment format, which included a time limit and restriction on reference materials being that students were not to communicate with one another or use resources outside their class notes and/or textbook. Upon completion of the assignment, both groups of students analyzed the same issues in the 3D manufacturing simulation while solving the same problems and proposing qualitative solutions to improve the overall system. Data was collected for the outside-the-classroom and inside-the-classroom groups in Fall 2021 and Fall 2022, respectively. The results of this study indicated no statistically significant difference in motivation, module usability score, engineering identity, self-assessment, or performance between the two groups. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We implemented small collaborative learning communities in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic to encourage connection between the students online and those who were able to come to class. We define classroom learning communities as small groups of students who sit together and are encouraged to discuss concepts together during class discussion times, such as before answering TopHat questions and during in-class problem solving sessions. Because the learning communities were so successful during the pandemic, we continued to use them in five offerings of two different classes over the past two years. We are a large department with core class sizes ranging from approximately 40-120 students. Learning communities were used in a material balances class that is the first chemical engineering class for our students. This class utilized a flipped format. Learning communities were also used in fluid mechanics, which is typically taken the semester after material balances. This class is lecture-based with active learning components. Two of these classes were mixed-mode (some students online and some in person), and three were completely in person. Surveys were administered to students in each class to answer our research questions: 1. Does the sense of belonging within the learning community, within the class, and within the department change with mixed-mode versus in-person, lecture-based versus flipped, 1<sup>st</sup> class versus 2<sup>nd</sup> class, and expected course grade? 2. Do students perceive a benefit in their learning by participating in the learning communities? 3. What are the factors that influence how the groups are formed and if they are changed throughout the semester? Students in the current offering of the fluid mechanics course, which uses learning communities and some active learning, took one of two offerings of the material balances class: one a flipped class using learning communities and one a lecture course without learning communities. Surveys of these students reveal that learning communities of 5-7 students improve students' engagement in class, help them learn, and increase their sense of belonging. Student comments indicate that imposter syndrome is lessened: it was helpful to know that others in their learning community were having similar struggles with the material they were learning in class. Students also report that learning communities help them learn and help them break the ice in meeting new people in class. Students further report that the learning communities foster social relationships as well; they report meeting new people who they would otherwise not have met. Self-assessment shows that they feel a greater sense of belonging to learning communities than to the department. Interestingly, the sense of belonging to the learning community increases for students expecting a lower grade in the class, while sense of belonging in the department decreases with expected class grade. Students highly recommend the continuation of learning communities in the future. From instructor observation, it is noticeable that most students are participating in small group discussions with each other once they are assigned to a learning community - they physically pull closer to other students around them and start discussing the discussion questions and/or in-class problem solving. We also notice that some of the students sitting off by themselves are getting engaged with their communities and working together. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of small in-class learning communities for sense of belonging and student learning, this paper describes how these learning communities are formed and how they can be used in various offerings of courses. This will include how to create the learning communities, how students assessed their peers' contribution to their learning and thoughts about making changes to the groups during the semester. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Engineering, like architecture and art & design, is well served by creativity. Architecture programs, both building and landscape, emphasize creativity and encourage exploration of the student's capacities for creative design through intensive immersion in “studio culture.” Although art & design programs do not typically tout the benefits of studio culture to the degree that architecture programs do (e.g. [1]), studio classes also play an important role in most art & design programs. Studio inculcates an atmosphere of intellectual curiosity, cooperative learning, collaboration, and respectful consideration of new ideas and multiple points of view. Such attributes would contribute to the quality of teamwork encountered in the multidisciplinary design-team environment in which engineers typically function today. The author teaches courses that primarily support a Landscape Architecture Accreditation Board (LAAB)-accredited [2] Landscape Architecture undergraduate program housed in the University of Delaware's College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. His courses, all cross-listed in landscape architecture and civil engineering, often have a mix of landscape architecture and engineering students simultaneously enrolled. Engineering students in civil, environmental, and construction engineering are represented. Data are examined that indicate the studio format promotes enhanced student learning in at least one important common element of the courses: mastery-based problem sets designed to improve student analytical abilities and technical skills. The data, gathered for two courses over 8 semesters and for 257 students clearly show that students master more of the problem set material under the studio/flipped classroom format. This paper examines the typical structure of studios in architecture and landscape architecture programs and discusses some observations the author has had with use of the studio format in his courses. The complementary nature of studio and the flipped classroom are examined. The positive influence of studio culture on creativity, collaboration, cooperative learning, and the engineering design process are considered. Recommendations are proposed for incorporation of studio format courses in engineering programs beyond the obvious application in senior design courses. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The study of electric power systems is extremely vital and relevant due to the ongoing efforts to modernize the grid. The authors are trying to shift from carbon-based energy sources to renewable energy sources. This requires developing the workforce of the future which can handle these contemporary challenges. Two of the most useful tools when it comes to the analysis of electric power systems are power flow simulation and fault studies. There are simulators that are provided to universities for educational purposes so that students can learn how to run power flow simulations and use the results for analysis and design. The problem that the authors have observed is that students need a better intuition on how to interpret the results. This leads to students accepting erroneous results simply because the simulation produced them. In this paper, the authors propose a methodology for teaching power systems analysis that teaches students how to run power flow simulations using a commercial tool and gives them a deep intuition of what the simulator is doing. The authors propose that students learn how to truly learn to use a simulator by developing one from scratch. This simulator is developed over the course of a semester by coupling the active learning techniques of the flipped classroom model and project-based learning. In the course, students watch videos prior to class to learn about modeling and implementation techniques. In the class, students work with instructors and teaching assistants to build a simulator in a modular approach. Students then validate the results of the simulator that they are developing with a commercial simulator. Using this teaching methodology, students learn the first-principles physics equations for steady-state power systems and the techniques to implement them. As a bonus, the authors can teach students about the software development process giving them an added skill set that is usually not part of the traditional power systems engineering student's CV. The end goal of producing students who can run power flow and fault studies and use them for design and analysis is still achieved; however, students have a much deeper understanding of what the simulator is doing “under the hood.” In this paper, the authors detail the structure of the course, course topics, the term project, midterm assessments & checkoffs, and the final project. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we preliminarily examine the notion of the “surroundings” in an engineering classroom. We posed an open-ended reflection question to engineering undergraduates at a large US university about their classroom surroundings and its impact on their learning and comprehension. The reflection prompt defined surroundings as the “conditions and objects that surround you.” This reflection question was part of an NSF-funded study on the use of weekly reflection in a flipped fluid mechanics course to drive metacognitive development and lifelong learning skills. During class, students were encouraged to collaborate with their peers during problem solving to achieve collective understanding and interact with the instructor. Based on an inductive, emergent content analysis of the reflection data with two analysts, we obtained an unexpected result. Specifically, the most-frequently mentioned positive classroom “surroundings” was “peers” (46% of responses). We had initially expected less-positive responses related to the physical surroundings, such as classroom layout, size, furniture, infrastructure, etc. Although students identified the classroom's physical attributes as surroundings that had both negative and positive influences on their learning, a second unexpected positive response emerged with the instructor and in-person instruction as part of the “surroundings.” Upon searching the literature to understand these results, we adopted the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework. This model consists of three interacting components of cognitive presence, social presence, and teaching presence, which enable educational experiences and learning. When combined, the Community of Inquiry elements (i.e., peers, instructor, and in-class instruction) were discussed in 55% of the reflections as positive “surroundings.” Within the classroom ecosystem, feelings about positive CoI “surroundings” balanced 54% of respondents who discussed the physical room attributes as non-supportive to learning. Interestingly, when students identified their CoI as a type of surrounding, they less-frequently identified physical attributes of the classroom as non-supportive. Thus, the presence of a Community of Inquiry may have diminished the perception or impact of physical room features. Overall, our results preliminarily suggest the positive influence that an interactive flipped classroom structure can have on students' perceptions of their “surroundings.” © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In a flipped classroom, students are responsible for acquiring a basic understanding of the topics before classes by watching pre-recorded videos, reading textbooks, or completing assignments, which prepares them for meaningful engagement during in-class activities. Subsequently, the class time is spent on interactive active learning and reinforcement of knowledge, typically through group problem-solving in engineering courses. The success of flipped classrooms highly depends on student participation in pre-class learning activities. The students who do not fully complete the pre-class activities are usually lost and left out during in-class activities, which can consequently result in loss of interest or even failing the course due to adverse cascade effects of unpreparedness. This paper discusses the impact of course modalities on student participation rates in pre-class and in-class activities and its correlation with student performance. An undergraduate fluid mechanics course was delivered in an in-person and online flipped classroom format during 2021 and 2022 as the campus went through the phased re-opening. The student participation in the pre-class activities was measured through video viewer data and the in-class activity participation was tracked by class attendance. The paper reports that the modality of other courses that students were co-enrolled in at the time of taking the flipped classroom affected student participation more than the modality of the flipped classroom itself. Both pre-class and in-class participation rates decreased as the percentage of in-person courses in the department increased. In addition, a correlation was found between the percentage of students who fully watched videos and the percentage of students who received B or higher grades. Lastly, recommendations are made to increase pre-class participation in an in-person flipped classroom. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The offering of the new methodology was composed of preclass (knowledge acquisition), in-class (knowledge internalization), and after-class (knowledge application) stages, and the WeChat applet Mu classroom with m-learning technology was adopted in the in-class stage. To improve the teacher–student interactions and communication, several interactive activities were designed based on Mu classroom, including random roll calls, open questions, objective questions, discussion, and extended discussion. After using the integrated method, the average score of each final exam was improved significantly (p <.05), and the failed (<60) percentage was decreased significantly (p =.002 <.01). Positive correlation between the scores of in-class quizzes and discussion and final exam were obtained (R<sup>2</sup> =.530, p <.001), indicating that students' outcomes were greatly affected by mobile learning. Moreover, positive feedback from students' questionnaires confirmed that the integrated approach was effective and could motivate students' learning interests and knowledge understanding. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

While most students were satisfied with the flipped classroom and expressed appreciation for the flexibility, freedom and independence induced by the teaching method, other students expressed frustrations. Based on two surveys with both open-ended and closed-ended questions, this paper explores possible reasons why a flipped classroom can be a source of frustration. Some students expressed having difficulty adjusting their study habits to the flipped classroom approach as well as having difficulty finding the motivation to watch the required learning videos before in-class activities. While some students experienced the group work associated with the flipped classroom format as a positive aspect of their learning, other students expressed irritation because of group members not meeting prepared for the group assignments. The expressed experiences are discussed in light of the self-determination theory and the self-regulated learning theory. Weaknesses with how the flipped classroom was implemented are also discussed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In traditional engineering education, students usually have little training on project implementation. Therefore, students have few chances to cultivate and develop their high-level cognitive abilities for the sake of achieving sustainable learning practices. We carried out two consecutive studies to overcome this issue. In both studies, we incorporated a flipped classroom approach into the project-based engineering education curriculum. Twelve junior graduate students majoring in electrical engineering participated in Study 1, and ten junior graduate students participated in Study 2. They all took the Signal Processing of Power Quality Disturbances class and practiced their skills in a computer lab, using LabView software. After we found from the results of Study 1 that the learning activities placed a heavier load on students and their advanced cognitive skills were not developed well, the reciprocal teaching method was introduced to students in Study 2. We assumed that the reciprocal teaching method could improve these outcomes, as well as achieve sustainable learning practices. The results demonstrated that students’ load in Study 2 was reduced, and their high-level cognitive skills improved compared to those in Study 1. Based on these results, we conclude that the reciprocal teaching method can be incorporated into the flipped classroom during project-based engineering education, as it helps prevent students from becoming overloaded, facilitates cognitive abilities from basic to high, and ensures sustainable learning practices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Active learning methods are known to improve motivation, engagement, and student performance in traditional classrooms. However, the COVID-19 pandemic compelled students to continue their studies through an online setting wherein teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. In this study, the design and implementation of flipped classrooms supported with collaborative learning was evaluated for the remote instruction of Analytical Chemistry. The flipped classroom was designed to include pre-recorded lectures, individual self-assessment questions and in-class group activities (polls and quiz bee). Word problems were given as collaborative tasks to improve the students’ interactions on the learning content. The impact on learning of these instructional practices was evaluated based on students’ learning experience and academic performance, and the instructors’ reflection. The survey at the end of the term gathered quantitative and qualitative data regarding students’ experiences with flipped classroom and peer collaboration methods. The students’ feedback indicated that participation in group collaborative activities had a positive impact on their comprehension of Analytical Chemistry concepts and calculations. Majority of the students indicated that group collaboration was immensely helpful in enhancing communication skills and improving their ability to apply what they had learned in class to solving difficult word problems. In addition, students underscored the importance of pre-recorded videos for their self-paced learning, and synchronous sessions to increase their engagement and motivation. On the other hand, several students perceived flipped classrooms as very demanding and challenging in terms of the required output submissions given the short 6-week term. Overall, the combination of these active-learning methods had a positive impact on the remote-learning environment, but potential drawbacks of online active learning interventions on student attitudes were also present. Therefore, careful integration of these instructional practices into online courses will help improve the students’ learning experience. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Implementing active learning in a HyFlex environment during the Fall of 2020 global pandemic was challenging. We describe the Interactive Synchronous HyFlex approach to teaching design thinking at the introductory college level and explore impacts on students’ basic psychological needs, including autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Aligned with Self-Determination Theory, active learning has been shown to motivate students and increase performance and retention in science, engineering, and mathematics disciplines, among others (Freeman et al., 2014; Lo & Hew, 2019). In active environments, the predominant mode of instruction is not lecture based and it engages students through student–to–student interactions and student–to–instructor interactions. The flipped classroom is a pedagogical model in which the typical lecture and homework elements of a course are reversed. This model of instruction is ideal for our design thinking course used as a context for this study because students are challenged to learn by doing. In active learning courses, students engage in video-recorded lectures or talks, text-based materials and online quizzes, or other preparation activities before and in preparation for class (Bishop & Verleger, 2013; Lo et al., 2017; O’Flaherty & Phillips, 2015). Scheduled class meeting time is used for engagement and interaction between students informed by a social constructivist learning theory. Students challenge each other to apply what they have learned with guidance and support from the instructor. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This article explores the impact of using audiovisual materials on the teaching-learning processes, particularly in a course of Calculus A for Engineering degree programs at the National University of Mar del Plata (Argentina). The different stages in the design, elaboration, and implementation of various resources are presented. The contents covered through these materials correspond to Polar and Parametric Equations. As part of the process of using these materials, the modality known as Flipped Classroom was implemented, where the student's activity takes place before and during the in-person class. The theoretical framework used to analyze the didactic aspects is the Ontosemiotic Approach. The evaluation of these materials and their impact was carried out through teachers and students surveys. The latter valued these resources positively and showed a preference for videos with the visible presence of a teacher explaining instead of PowerPoint presentations with voice-over. The implementation of this type of material has also been extended to other contents of the course. In this way, this approach promotes active student participation in the learning process and focuses on the preferences of a digital native generation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Society is currently facing many global challenges, and these issues show no sign of abating over the next decades. According to the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), higher education plays a key role in empowering future professionals to become leaders in driving sustainable economic, social, or environmental transition.Green skills, digital competence, holistic approach, and SDGs, among others are therefore vital. However, are universities providing students with these skills? Many students are not aware of these subjects and do not study them at university either. In fact, engineering students will have to solve problems that are usually overlooked in technological universities: climate change and its effects on poverty and migration, scarcity of water and resources, pollution, and gender inequality, to mention a few. In recent years, an increasing number of innovative learning methodologies have been implemented in the Engineering faculty at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (Spain): flipped classroom, challenge-based learning, teamwork, creativity and innovation, and collective intelligence. This has led to the development of collaborative networks with other European universities and the sharing of resources and methodologies. This chapter presents and analyses successful learning experiences, problems and difficulties, and testimonials from students and professors from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, complemented by other published cases. Present and future approaches that may guide other colleagues to integrate sustainability in education, working together with companies, public administrations, NGOs, and other agents, are also explored. Higher education classes and university campuses are the best laboratory for designing and making sustainable cities and communities a reality. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The use of a flipped classroom pedagogy has gained significant momentum in engineering education over the past decade. More instructors are taking on the challenge of transitioning their courses to a flipped classroom pedagogy to allow for more active learning and support during class time. While there are many benefits to the use of flipped classrooms in engineering courses, there are many challenges associated to the implementation and sustainability of this approach. Additionally, first year educators may be hesitant to transition their courses to a flipped classroom model due to fears that students may not be ready for such a dramatic shift in classroom approach. The Engineering Fundamentals Program in the Tickle College of Engineering at the University of Tennessee Knoxville is a common, student success-based first year program that teaches engineering physics, introduction to computer programming, design, teamwork and communication to over 1000 students per semester. In Spring 2018, our unit began an initiative to flip all courses associated with our program. In previous years, one course had attempted flipping a portion of the content in the course to provide more time for active learning. While performance data showed an improvement due to the flip [site paper], student feedback was negative towards a mid-semester shift in learning approach due to increased demands for adapting to the new style. In Spring 2018, the EF team decided to commit to flipping the program in an effort to provide a more positive experience for students in the transition to a new classroom environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Game developers are beginning to understand it is important to approach computer game design like how all software engineers approach projects involving large numbers of people and significant investment of time. Engineering instructors often rely on the traditional lecture model when they teach topics to a classroom of students. Students often fail to engage with the material presented bylecturers. Many engineering educators regard experiential learning as an effective way to train future generations of engineers and game developers. The authors have created two courses that focus on software engineering and game development. These courses were initially offered as traditional lecture classes to both in-person and online groups of students. This chapter describes the authors’ approaches to revising these game design classes to make use of flipped classroom models that rely on active learning, role-play, and gamification to cover software engineering topics in these courses. Students learn to use Agile software engineering practices to design, implement, and test game prototypes. In-person students were surveyed to measure their perceived levels of engagement with course activities. Our assessment data suggests that students attending flipped class meetings were slightly more engaged with the course materials than those taking the class offered using lectures only. Students interacting with the active learning course materials felt better able to apply their knowledge than students in a traditional lecture course. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the context of engineering education, to improve the practical engineering skills of engineering students, the teaching ideas and implementation methods of the curriculum are designed based on Outcome-based Education. A blended teaching approach was used to design the implementation process to achieve the curriculum objectives. In this paper, we explain the process of blended teaching from the two aspects of basic knowledge and competency training. Active learning of basic knowledge is implemented based on a three-step blended teaching model before, after, and during classes. It adopts the project-driven learning approach of the flipped classroom model and cultivates students' ability to solve complex engineering problems through collaborative group and intra-group mutual assessment. Based on the original objective assessment of the curriculum and under the current teaching model, we design a diversified evaluation approach to comprehensively assess the effectiveness of student competence achievement. Practice has shown that project-based inquiry-based teaching methods based on the flipped classroom model can promote learning outcomes for students and increase their interest in learning. It avoids the blind and aimless theoretical learning process of the student and improves the practical ability of the student. The methods and means of instruction of teachers have been further extended, and the ability of students to learn independently has been improved. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, only a handful of students in many classrooms participate regularly, a phenomenon dubbed as "consolidation of responsibility".

Pedagogies such as active learning, group learning, project-based learning and flipped classroom. Technologies to automate attendance taking, raising hand as well as for online learning to detect participation, analyze participation, and provide participation feedback.We introduce SKOR, a class participation system that automates fair student participation without wasting class time. We conducted an experiment to know if SKOR kept student updated on their participation points and if it is more efficient and fairer at collecting participation. Our finding is that using SKOR did not have any significant difference on student perception of class participation. However, teacher influences the perception more. Students like shared learning, fairness, and more participation options. They dislike limited opportunity, apprehension and assessing quantitative participation over qualitative participation. These are aligned with our literature review. We hope our review and experiment provide teachers with ideas to improve participation in their classroom. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This Research-to-Practice full paper presents an explorative study investigating the effects of flipped learning on the learning motivation of primary school students enrolled in a block-based programming course. Technology development has increased the importance of information technology-related competencies for the new generation. Programming skills are essential in various industries nowadays. Thus, programming education has become necessary to cultivate students' relevant abilities to meet the rapid pace of development. Programming learning encourages students to think logically and systematically, solve problems effectively, and develop computational thinking skills. However, learning programming is challenging for many students for different reasons, such as its inherent complexity, inadequate study methods, and pedagogical approaches unsuited to promote programming learning. Traditional teaching methods are often impersonalized and only suitable for some learning styles present in class. Moreover, the challenges encountered by the students as novice programmers are attributed to their low learning motivation. To learn to program, students must comprehend different syntactic conventions, complex instructions, and logical operators and actively engage in practical learning activities, often facing difficulties. This may reduce their learning motivation leading to failure and dropout. To accommodate different learning styles and increase students' motivation, this study employed the ARCS motivation model to design various innovative activities in a flipped classroom setting to increase students' motivation and improve teachers' teaching effectiveness. The study utilized a pretest-posttest method with two groups of grade five students to compare the effectiveness of teaching and learning between the flipped and traditional classroom students. The study's findings revealed that the flipped classroom experimental group showed significantly higher learning motivation than the students in the control group. Moreover, it was found that different flipped classroom activities, including the use of gamification, flipped videos, self-study, self-questioning, self-assessment, split programming tasks, group cooperation, and demonstration activities, had a positive influence on various sub-dimensions of the ARCS model, such as attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this Research Full paper, we present a comparative study of using two pedagogical approaches, Peer Instruction (PI) and Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning-like (POGIL-like) in software testing. We discuss our results from multiple studies conducted over a period of four years, both in-person and online, using both PI and POGIL-like in undergraduate software engineering classrooms. Our particular focus is on the topics of unit testing, integration testing, and continuous integration. We compare learning outcomes and shifts in student attitudes compared to pure lecture-based instruction. We included two studies conducted using PI in undergraduate software engineering classes. In these studies, we examined how PI can be used to teach the 3 topics mentioned above. They replicated their own studies over a period of two years and found consistently significant cognitive gains and positive affective shifts in both an in person and online class. For POGIL-like, we included two studies in an undergraduate software engineering class - one in-person, and one online. The intervention design centered around the core tenets of POGIL: no prior information given to students (which is the exact opposite of a flipped classroom), and carefully crafted 'models' and 'activities'. POGIL-like utilizes 'learning cycles', and activity questions are crafted based on the Explore-Invent-Apply cycle combined with Directed/Convergent/Divergent question types, all aimed at encouraging students to leverage the collective knowledge of the group. These approaches, based on social constructivist concepts, have been well studied in STEM disciplines but are relatively recent arrivals in CS. Our particular contribution is that we analyze both pedagogies in teaching software testing, using results from studies that utilized the same instructor and course materials. We analyze the similarities and differences between both pedagogical approaches, and rate their suitability in teaching software engineering and software testing. Our primary research questions are: •RQl: How do students learn software testing and DevOps using PI and POGIL-like compared to pure lecture format classes? •RQ2: What are the relative advantages and disadvantages for PI and POGIL-like from the instructor's perspective? In each of the studies we analyzed, we collected and classified individual student responses from a pre- and post- course survey for each implementation of the course (lecture, PI or POGIL; in person or online; honors or regular). The pre- and post-surveys each included two components: a technical, content-related survey specifically designed to test student knowledge and synthesis in unit testing, integration testing, and continuous integration, followed by a standard affective instrument aimed at gauging student attitudes and perceptions around the same topics. We adopted within-groups and between-groups Analysis of Variance techniques to determine statistical significance in our correlations. In all 4 studies involving PI and POGIL-like, we found encouraging results showing that students had learned significantly better than pure lecture alone. In this paper, for both PI and POGIL-like, we discuss and compare overall correctness for each group, as well as cognitive and affective gains based on the pre- and post- surveys. We also classify the relative strengths and weaknesses of each pedagogy based on student feedback. We discuss the similarities in these approaches as well as implementation differences, in addition to impediments faced while implementing them, along with ideas to encourage increase more widespread adoption of these evidence-based pedagogies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the continuous development of artificial intelligence, more and more attention has been paid to improving students’ computational thinking capability in K-12 and higher education. Lots of research has shown that there is a close relationship between engineering education and computational thinking. Engineering thinking and computational thinking intertwine to some extent. The cultivation of engineering students’ computational thinking ability could be integrated into engineering content learning. However, in current research, there is limited research on how to improve engineering students’ computational thinking in an integrated way. Therefore, this study adopted Web Problem-Based Learning (WPBL) in a flipped engineering undergraduate course with the aim of enhancing students’ computational thinking performance in an active way of engineering content learning. A total of 110 third-year undergraduates participated in this quasi-experimental study. The 55 students the experimental group who learned via WPBL in flipped classroom performed significantly better than the other 55 students in the control group who learned via Q and A, mini-lectures and data analysis as in-class learning activities in flipped classroom. Specifically, the experimental group scored significantly higher on the Abstraction and Algorithm Thinking dimensions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The field of mobile robotics is characterised by the presence of large sources of errors in both sensor and actuator models. As such, it requires advanced knowledge in the representation of uncertainty in dynamic systems and it is seldom approached by undergraduate level courses. Moreover, the vast richness of robot and environment imperfections cannot be aptly captured by simulations. We propose a new approach to teach mobile robotics in undergrad classes by adopting a flipped classroom. The theoretical aspects of mobile robotics are provided to the students as reading material and video lectures to be studied before the classroom. In the classroom the students apply their newly acquired knowledge by making a mobile robot perform specific tasks. A mobile robot was developed specifically for this flipped classroom with differential steering, inertial sensors and a digital camera. The lectures cover topics such as Bayesian State estimation, Computer Vision, Kalman Filters, Particle Filters and Monte Carlo Navigation. This new approach applied to students of the Mechatronics Engineering Program of the Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo. Students' evaluation was very positive. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {21st century students are expecting an educational system that works for and with them. The teaching-learning process is shifted from teacher-centered to student-centered through innovative teaching-learning techniques. With the advancement of technology and globalization, communication skills in English language, as a life-long learning skill is an essential component in engineering education as an employability skill. Communication is one of 11 key outcomes designed by Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). Listening, speaki ng, readi ng, and wri t i ng (LSRW) are considered as four basic language skills, contributed major role in developing communication skills in English language. Though all skills are equally important, writing is the stepping stone in verbal communication yet difficult to acquire without knowledge or mastery on the remaining three skills. Currently teaching-learning process is shifted from chalk and talk to the implementation of various approaches based on cooperative and collaborative l earni ng and i nt egrat i on of Informat i on and Communication Technology in English Proficiency class. Some effective approaches are computer assisted language learning, mobile assisted language learning, technology enabled language learning, project based, problem based & puzzle-based language learning, flipped classroom based language learning, and task based language learning. The pr es ent paper ai ms t o s t udy t he e f f e ct i ve implementation of Task based approach in English language classroom to develop writing skills of F. Y. B. Tech students with other 21st century life skills by implementing various tasks-based activities as per need analysis of learners in order to ensure their active participation. Total 50 students were enrolled as an experimental group. The impact of selected approach was evaluated using quantitative and qualitative methodologies. The quantitative assessment was based on rating method whereas the qualitative was based on rubrics. The findings revealed that there is significant improvement not only in the writing skills of experimental group students but also listening, speaking, and reading skills, leading to effective communication skills in English Language. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

They represent an important learning value to promote knowledge creation and translation for in-class, blended, and online learning. Effective creation and sharing of videos are enriched when instructors consider several principles: how to promote digital literacy in the class environment; how to maximize student engagement in making and sharing videos; how a video can make a tangible difference in the education landscape, and how to utilize this process to promote value creation in education? This article reviews literature relevant to each of these principles and presents a case of making educational videos in the context of value creation in teaching ethical professional practice in engineering and computing. The case advocates several feasible approaches instructors may embrace to assimilate knowledge creation, digital engagement, critical thinking, and growth mindset that allow students to take ownership of their learning. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A change in the pedagogical approach and techniques is established in two subjects of the Mechanical Engineering Degree of the University of Cantabria, in order to solve problems detected during the last decade and accentuated with the pandemic. Specifically, in first pilot, two main changes are to be performed with respect to previous years. A mixed pedagogical approach is adopted, where both the Traditional and Flipped Classroom are combined, making the class time more valuable and engaging better with the students, and a collaborative project to an “open-problem” is proposed for the students to solve in groups of three, where the majority of the competences are exercised. In this regard, the use of Technology Enhanced Learning has been seen essential in order to facilitate students’ access to the knowledge and contents. In University of Cantabria context, Kaltura tool was used for this purpose, which is embedded in Moodle platform. In the second pilot, students currently have the contents of the course in “slide” format before the class sessions, therefore, the generation of audiovisual resources will consist of the complement and support of the current teaching mechanisms used. In order to aid a better student follow-up, a one-year action plan has been developed. Within this plan, it is the second month of the project and therefore, the need of the audiovisual resources has been outlined and some videos have been created. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This work describes an incremental design of a course that implements the flipped classroom methodology. The last phase of this implementation was to include rewards based on self-evaluation tests that would impact the students' grades. This should foster students' engagement with the learning methodology. In this work, a deep analysis of the impact of the reward is performed. The analysis of the use of the out-class materials shows that the students' pace does not correspond to the flipped classroom methodology. The students' behaviour is more focused on achieving rewards rather than preparing in-class activities with out-class materials. It is hypothesized that, the main reasons for these behaviours could be that, on the one hand, since the reward is considered by students as another item of the course grade, they work to get the reward. On the other hand, students do not want to change their study methodology because getting involved in the flipped methodology requires from them a significant effort. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, the limited class hours in the university makes it much more difficult to realize the computational thinking ability cultivation. So it is important to design the highly integrated and connotative college computer courses based on the limited class hours, meeting the requirements of the computer technology and the information quantity for the new engineering. This paper introduces the blending teaching method for integrated college computer course based on MOOCs. With the help of multiple high-quality MOOC resources, SPOC is constructed to deeply explore the mode of online and offline mixed teaching practice and the teaching method of flipped classroom, which is useful for the talent cultivation of new engineering. At last, a blended teaching reform and practice based on MOOCs is carried out in the course “Computer Science and Programming (C)” and some evaluation statistical analysis are conducted. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The National Innovation System found that research in Jordan did not contribute sufficiently to economic growth and to solving real-world challenges, particularly those related to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). This was attributed to several reasons, including the inability of educational curricula to guide students in dealing with real-world issues. In addition, education in Jordan is content-intensive and primary school children lack the time to build functional competencies such as problem-solving. Therefore, it was necessary to adopt an approach allowing students to learn the theoretical content on their own while allocating class time to practice problemsolving activities with their teacher and peers. To address this gap, this study aimed at designing an engineering-based module for a flipped STEM classroom to aid grade seven students in developing their problem-solving abilities based on Merrill’s first principles of instruction as an instructional design model. To generate the module components and aspects, semi-structured interviews were performed with 9 subject matter experts. Then, 29 experts responded and offered a consensus on what was reached in the previous interview. A total of 36 items were discussed by the expert panel using the Likert 7-point scale in the fuzzy Delphi approach. The five-module aspects namely; the form of STEM integration, the assessment, the resources, and the pre-class and in-class instructional activities, were determined. This research will usher in a new era for the Ministry of Education. in planning and teaching integrated STEM disciplines in line with Jordan’s vision 2025 to equip all learners with 21stcentury skills such as problem-solving to enhance education standards to international levels. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the deepening of the concept of knowledge society, the traditional college Chinese education is undergoing profound changes, which has gradually changed to "learning centered". Therefore, deep learning, core literacy and other teaching concepts have become the focus of current higher education, which has gradually been integrated with new teaching methods, such as flipped classroom and Mu class. Through multi form teaching methods, the teaching mode of information technology and curriculum integration has become the pursuit of in-depth learning in Chinese teaching, which is a learning mode of pursuing more diversified learning objectives of students. Through in-depth learning, the learning process of college Chinese will be more engaged and participatory, which will help students' cognitive processing methods, mainly including the connection of new and old knowledge, critical understanding, information integration, etc. Deep learning will increase the level of students' input and participation in the learning process, which will better develop the core quality of long-term memory and transfer of knowledge. Therefore, the construction of college Chinese teaching system based on deep learning technology is very necessary. This paper first analyzes the current research on the application of deep learning technology. Then, this paper analyzes the data analysis model of deep learning process. Finally, this paper constructs the college Chinese teaching system and puts forward some suggestions, which can better construct the teaching system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A survey is proposed here to evaluate students’ satisfaction before and after the MFT experiences. To create the reliability study, two MFT experiences were carried out in distinctive knowledge areas (education and engineering) and different academic levels (first and third academic year). The evaluation tool presented here (pre-MFT and post-MFT versions) has a high degree of reliability, both in technical and educational degrees and for students without prior experience in this type of educational methodology, as well as for those who do. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Microwave engineering is regaining importance as the world is witnessing the emergence of a new industrial revolution spearheaded by the internet of things and 5G communications and wireless networks. Preparing α-generation microwave engineering students for the future, especially in post-COVID era, represents a considerable challenge to universities worldwide that seldom offer a full autonomous course at the undergraduate level. Engineering curriculum should be revisited in order to incorporate skills suitable for work-based learning with emphasis on developing human-centred ICT competencies. Flipped classrooms are specifically attractive in engineering education to ensure deep comprehension of course material. A flipped microwave-engineering course with focus on amplifier design has therefore been re-designed with course learning outcomes aligned with Bloom’s taxonomy and ABET program outcomes. The new learning cycle in the flipped mode, allow reaching the top cognitive pyramid where student exercised decision-making and practiced meta-cognitive knowledge and skills. The stretched flipped classroom represents a paradigm shift in instructional methodology and offers several advantages to the learning process at high cognitive levels as learning occurs in a comfortable pace where students collaborate with instructors in course design, curricula and delivery. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Parametric software currently used for technical drawing learning in engineering careers allows the generation of 3D models of parts, including restrictions and relations between elements, and even different configurations of a same part. Therefore, models incorporate a large amount of information about design intent, so the criteria assuring quality (such as model consistency, or design intent conveyance) should be considered. Moreover, new teaching–learning trends incorporate the application of methodologies that make the student more involved in the learning process, such as the flipped classroom, in which the student is asked to do some work prior to the face-to-face class. This study aims to analyse the effectiveness of the flipped classroom methodology, when applied to improve the performance and evaluation of 3D modelling parts. To achieve it, quality criteria for modelling, established in a formative rubric used in the subject, have been applied. The study has been developed in the context of an engineering first course subject about Graphic Expression. Seventy-four students from different engineering degrees participated in the experience and answered a questionnaire. Results showed that the flipped methodology was positively considered in terms of studying and learning as well as for peer and self-assessment. In addition, using the formative rubric was assessed as appropriate and understandable. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The application of FC improves teaching and learning process, especially in applied sciences and technology, as literature study reveals. The current study aims to investigate the application of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) methodology, by applied sciences and technology teachers, who combine FC to improve learning results and better meet their teaching goals. To this end, we apply quantitative research, exploit, and discuss our data findings. A total number of 65 high school teachers, around the area of Central Greece, in the region of Thessaly, took part in our research. Our data is analyzed via Structural Equation Models (SEMs) which belong to a family of multivariable statistical analysis that refer to linear correlations among quantitative mainly variables, with confirmatory role. The results of our study reveal that social influence is significant for the prediction of teachers’ intention (current of future) to apply flipped classroom model approach. Additionally, our study claims to support that flipped classroom model plays a crucial role in updating educational demands of the 21st century, especially in guaranteeing the use of technology tools in equally during teaching and learning process.

	abstract = {Due to the spread of COVID-19 worldwide, a large number of universities had to close their campuses. To maintain teaching and learning during this disruption to the traditional teaching, most universities have adopted online teaching model. The current study aimed at investigating the efficacy of various online teaching modes as well as comparing a proposed combined model of online and flipped learning to other online and traditional models. The Learning under COVID-19questionnaire was designed and administered to undergraduate engineering students at Chengdu University of Information Technology (CUIT). The questionnaire included five parts: demographic questions, frequencies of online courses, types of online courses, the communication and Q&A in online classes and the effect of online classes, as well as the effect of combined model learning. The results of the study showed that, students were dissatisfied with online learning in general, and they were especially dissatisfied with the communication and Q&A modes. In addition, the combined model of online teaching with the flipped learning improved students’ learning, attention, and evaluation of courses. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Computational Science and Engineering (CS&E) is a relatively new discipline for which no consensus exists on how classes should best be taught. Many CS&E courses are compressed add-ons to existing programs and, consequently, must cover a breadth of topics encompassing modules from mathematics, statistics, computer science, and application disciplines. Additionally, these courses would benefit from embedded 21st century skills, including problem-solving, critical thinking, and lifelong learning behaviors, but such skills are often neglected in course design even though the education and workforce literature are clear about their importance for future careers. The breadth and complexity in course design necessary to incorporate all of these components create a challenge for instructors and students. In this interpretive study, we investigate student experiences and perceived outcomes in a technology-mediated graduate-level CS&E course designed to address the difficulties associated with this wide range of disciplinary topics and professional skills. Our course design is based on reflective practice and principles of metacognition, and applies elements such as a flipped classroom, student journals, and reflective writing exercises; these design goals directly support students’ metacognition and foster self-regulated learning behaviors that, in turn, develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. We evaluate this design using student reflective writing and surveys. Results indicate reflective writing activities in course design helped develop students’ metacognitive awareness, self-regulated learning behaviors, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills. This course design can serve as a template for others teaching technology-mediated courses in CS&E and related areas, and aiming to develop students’ 21st century professional skills. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A flipped classroom (FC) teaching approach offers a personalized learning environment for the learners to study the course using pre-recorded material prior to the in-class session. The synchronous sessions are then dedicated to knowledge confirmation and learning activities. Although this technique is considered promising, the learners’ acceptance of FC for skill-based courses conducted entirely via open distance learning (ODL) has yet to be assessed in Malaysia. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the FC approach's effectiveness and student readiness and acceptance during ODL. A questionnaire was used to assess the students’ adoption and overall implementation of FC. Results show that students who underwent the FC approach gave a better performance in their course. In fact, 39.29% of the students who underwent the FC approach managed to score A and A- compared to 19.82% of students that went for conventional delivery. Regarding the adoption, 100% of the surveyed students agreed that the pre-recorded video assisted them in preparing for the class. Furthermore, 100% of students surveyed agreed that they were able to prepare the simulation before the next class at the end of the semester, compared to 96.154% in the first 4 weeks. It can be concluded that the FC approach has been shown to be effective and easily adopted by students. Furthermore, the FC learning framework has been developed to map the learning activities and the learning domain. Principles such as How People Learn and Bloom taxonomy were embedded in the development of this framework. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a teaching model for the course of Electric Circuits for Engineering students of several programs, including Industrial Engineering, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, Electronics and Mechatronics. In this teaching model two main Engineering competencies are developed: A) Fundamentals of Systems and Engineering Devices and b) Problem Solving in Engineering. The model is based on Flipped Learning and it is centered in the solution of a challenge that students have to solve during the five week period of the intense course. The project chosen for this course is the analysis and simulation of a light meter using a photovoltaic cell, diodes, resistors and some light emitting diodes (LED). The project can be changed every year so that new students get a new challenge. The system is analyzed in different phases, as the course advances, more components are added and the number of connections is increased, scaling the complexity of the system and therefore, the direct application of the theoretical topics seen in class. The real-life applications that students have to work during the course by solving the challenge, increase the motivation of a course that is usually considered a difficult course by students. Results show that the use of flipped classroom for some sessions and the solution of a real case scenario (challenge) help students to review and assimilate the concepts seen in these intense five weeks of the course with high levels of motivation. . We present this work so that other universities, particularly those in developing nations, could include this type of challenge-based activities in the teaching of complex courses such as the Electric Circuits one. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Before class, we share course learning resources on the computer information technology platform, publish learning tasks or ask questions, etc., to cultivate students’ autonomous learning ability. In the classroom, the computer screen technology is used to carry out the group learning mode of divided class or flipped class by cases, short videos or practical training tasks. In addition, the computer interaction technology such as mobile phone answer, bullet screen, voting, theme discussion, in-class practice and evaluation and grading is used to mobilize the enthusiasm and participation of students in class. Finally, with the help of instant messaging tools or Super Star Learning APP testing system and other computer information technology, the test questions, homework or practical training tasks are released to realize the communication and interaction between students and teachers after class, and give feedback and guidance to students.

	abstract = {The pedagogy of a first-year engineering course in manufacturing is presented. This course entitled Manufacturing and Society involves collaboration with social science, is based on industrial robots as the central theme to attract students’ interests and utilizes the flipped classroom approach for delivery. We hypothesize that, in one semester, recent high school graduates will be able to gain knowledge in manufacturing by learning the computer-aided engineering (CAD) software, applying CAD to design a penholder, fabricating the penholder using additive manufacturing and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software, programming the robot to create a toolpath for the pen, drawing using the pen on the penholder guided by a robot, and elaborating on impacts of robotic painting on society from a social science perspective. This course is designed to give students, regardless of their intended major in engineering, broad knowledge in manufacturing via 10 engineering, 3 social science, and 10 technical communication lectures; 8 labs; and 4 projects. The social science lectures and discussions focus on how knowledge about society can be used to inform design and manufacturing decisions, social science research methods for understanding how engineers and technology can impact people's lives, and changing trends in work, the workplace, and the future workforce as it relates to manufacturing. This course aimed to give undergraduate first-year engineering students a positive view of advanced manufacturing and its impact on society. Student evaluations and comments were positive and affirmed the learning objective of teaching manufacturing to the first-year engineering students. The flipped classroom approach was demonstrated to be ideal during the COVID-19 pandemic with limited capacity for in-person lectures and labs. The use of flipped classrooms allowed students to learn at their own pace, review and reinforce knowledge, have a closer interaction with instructors, and reduce the number of technical errors using simulation tools. This course with the support of flipped classroom pedagogy can be successfully implemented in the post-pandemic era, devoting the time of the class to answer questions, expand upon the class content and have a closer in-person interaction with students. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Due to the public health policies put into place by institutions in response to the international COVID-19 pandemic, many engineering educators were required to implement alternative pedagogies into their courses. The flipped classroom was viewed by many educators as a method to continue to teach within the constraints created by the pandemic. At its most fundamental form, a flipped class moves activities, which commonly take place in-person, outside of the classroom by providing students with alternative educational resources. Students are expected to engage in these activities prior to attending class which allows students to use the valuable in-person class periods to complete example problems and study advanced topics in a collaborative and creative learning environment. In the 2021 academic year, the Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering at the U.S. Military Academy implemented the flipped classroom into four undergraduate civil engineering courses: Mechanics of Materials, Hydrology and Hydraulic Design, Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering, and Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures. The objective of this study is to evaluate the approach taken by each individual course to implement the flipped classroom pedagogy. The design of the four courses varied based on the execution of asynchronous content out-of-class, schedule for in-person learning, and delivery of graded assessments. The impact of each flipped course design was determined by comparing the results to historical student performance, the time spent by the students on out-of-class activities, and anecdotical feedback from both the instructors and students. The results of the study confirmed a more deliberate design approach is required than simply rearranging the order of learning activities to effectively execute a flipped course. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This is the culmination of a multi-year study involving a comparison of two distinct learning environments. New educational technologies are constantly emerging and evolving. One of the latest advances is adaptive courseware, which has the ability to tailor the assignments to each student's individual needs based on their own learning style, comprehension rate, prior knowledge base, and many other factors. An examination of student data on performance and retention spanning five years has been conducted in an undergraduate engineering fluid mechanics course. This study compares the results of a traditional learning environment to one which used a novel combination of adaptive courseware and an inverted classroom. Overall student performance increased, indicating that adaptive courseware in combination with an inverted classroom is a more efficient teaching methodology than the traditional lecture setting. Increases in overall class average, number of A's, and highest grade were found. Additionally, a survey of the students indicated that they preferred the new methodology as a whole. However, there were also negative effects as the number of D and F grades increased, as well the retention rate in the class decreased with the new methodology. These few negative results were somewhat counterintuitive, as this new methodology was primarily developed to assist underperforming students. Possible causes of these downsides are proposed, as well as future directions of this research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Yet most traditional college engineering courses (based on a lecture-homework format) offer few opportunities to provide individual students with descriptive feedback. This paper describes our department's recent experiences using flipped classroom instruction to improve feedback and attainment in our introductory thermodynamics course in Chemical Engineering at the University of Washington. In our implementation of a flipped class, traditional lectures are replaced with 20~40 minute instructional videos that incorporate course content, laboratory demonstrations, and how-to tutorials. Students view and take notes on these materials outside of class, and take an online “Prep Quiz” that provides feedback on their basic understanding before coming to class. Once in class, students spend most of their time working in table groups on complex multi-part problems that challenge their understanding and provide practice in key skills. As they work, the instructor and TAs check-in with each group, interrogate their thinking and problem solving strategies, and provide on-the-spot descriptive feedback as the students struggle with the material. At the end of each week a zero-stakes “Exit Quiz” provides further feedback, allowing each student to measure how deeply they understand the material. Summative assessment is conducted traditionally with exams, using a standards-based rubric. Six years of final exam data show that the grade distribution under a flipped format is more asymmetric than under a traditional lecture-homework format, with median students performing better relative to the mean. A seventh year of data collected during 100% remote teaching (due to the Covid-19 pandemic) is more difficult to interpret, but exhibits some of the same favorable features in the grade distribution. This paper also describes some of our practical observations and challenges in successfully implementing a flipped class. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This type of instruction is even harder lately due to higher education institutions' strict COVID-19 policies and procedures, since offering the courses in on-ground settings is not a possibility. One method practiced by a high number of educators to meet course learning outcomes and ABET student outcomes is to implement the Flipped Classroom technique. In a Flipped Classroom, course lectures and laboratories are provided to students earlier than the class time. Then, class times are used to provide more practice and content so that students can learn more in their regular lectures and lab hours. This paper reports the structure of a few Flipped Classroom courses from a diverse group of institutions and the evaluation results received from these courses. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a case study of the evidence-based practice of flipping a classroom. The flipped (or inverted) classroom has long been promoted as a method of improving student engagement in the classroom as it creates opportunities for active learning experiences during lecture time that would otherwise be consumed by passive instruction. A flipped classroom relies on students to independently prepare for class prior to the scheduled lecture time, typically by watching pre-lecture videos or by reading material assigned by the instructor. Having been exposed to the lecture material, synchronous class time can be used to complete active learning exercises in small groups with direct oversight and immediate feedback offered by the instructor. At Johns Hopkins University, Statics & Mechanics of Materials has been taught using a traditional lecture-style instructional mode to civil, environmental, and mechanical engineering majors for many years. Aware of the documented benefits of the flipped classroom model, in 2019 the author created a library of pre-lecture videos and accompanying in-class learning exercises to experiment with this instructional mode. In 2020, when universities shifted to virtual instruction as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, the author used these same materials to create an online version of the flipped classroom. Thus, over a three-year period, a single author teaching the same class with the same content and assessment methods collected data to evaluate the impacts of three different instructional modes on student performance, engagement, and satisfaction. In total, data from course evaluations, class attendance, and performance on final exams was collected from 213 students who took the course from 2018 to 2020. Consistent with the findings of previous studies, the data presented in this paper demonstrates that the flipped classroom results in greater student engagement and a higher level of student satisfaction with both the course and the instructor. The impact on student performance, however, is inconclusive, primarily due to the quasi-experimental nature of the study. Beyond presenting the results of the study, this paper will also describe the implementation of specific elements of the flipped and online flipped classrooms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The objective of the study is to evaluate formative assessments used to engage and support student learning in both the virtual and in-person learning environment in 2020 and 2021 for an undergraduate structural analysis class. In both the virtual and in-person learning environment, active learning and student engagement opportunities were created via a flipped classroom, which included breakout rooms in the virtual environment and in-person small groups to support problem-solving and peer teaching and learning. Formative assessments included recitation session lab assignments, homework assignments, and exams, where grades were analyzed to identify trends in student performance when the course was taught in-person, online, and at different institutions (i.e., University of Delaware and Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology) with different instructors but with the same textbook and learning outcomes. While some challenges existed in the virtual environment such as disengaged and even absent students, this study will highlight some of the lessons learned that helped to improve student learning. For example, most students liked being able to review lectures on demand. Hence, we hypothesized that having lectures accessible online, which did not occur when in-person learning resumed, was an asset and improved student learning, especially on topics such as construction of shear and moment diagrams, and analysis of beams and trusses subjected to various loads. To evaluate this hypothesis, the data analytics from our learning management system showed a correlation between the time students spent reviewing content area to how well students performed on the formative assessments by topic from 2020 and 2021. Based on the data captured in this study, best practices to determine to what extent student learning improved are examined and presented, and how these practices can guide teaching effectiveness in both the virtual and in-person learning environment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This evidence-based practice paper describes the study of Statics or Engineering Mechanics 1 course. This is an entry-level course for freshman or sophomores in many engineering disciplines and includes topics such as forces, equilibrium of forces, truss analysis, centroid, and moment of inertia. It is observed that this is a difficult course for students and the passing rate is 60.7% [1]. To reduce the failure rate of students in class, instructors often try to implement a variety of methods. Hands-on models, active learning methods, ExCEEd model [2], Flipped Classroom model [3], and Montessori Based Engineering (MBE) Model [4] are some of the models used by instructors. Student success improved by 3%-7% [5] when these methodologies were used. Hands-on models when used in combination with other active learning methods are engaging and useful in maintaining student interest [2]. In-class instruction is usually expected for active learning using hands-on models for Statics 1. This has been especially difficult during COVID-restricted learning situations and has created a learning gap between current students and former. This paper describes the use of Virtual Reality (VR), a computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional object or space, to fill both of these issues caused by remote learning.VR is a powerful flexible platform that when utilized can generate differentiating perspectives of problems. The VR tool Tilt Brush [6] was used to replace the physical hands-on models typically used in class to provide an engaging diverse experience. Typically, the students are introduced to a 3D Vector problem as a picture in a book or PowerPoint slide and the instructor proceeds to explain the problem using direct instruction. This method can work for some students. However, students might not be entirely clear on how the vectors and angles are actually represented in 3D space. Instructors have tried to use physical hands-on models to help students understand this concept. Most students develop an understanding of visualizing and analyzing 3D vectors after working with these physical models, thus it is great for in-person learning. However, this is not possible in an online environment. There is no denying that higher education is moving toward online learning [7]. COVID brought to everyone's attention how educators need to better prepare to transition into an online learning environment. With this in mind, the authors decided to create "hands-on models" in Virtual Reality. These models were presented in different formats in order to provide a variety of perspectives and to help engage the students in the learning module. Student engagement was very high for this module when students were shown videos. If it was made more hands-on by teaching synchronously, it is expected that student engagement would be even higher. Development of teaching this 3D Vector module, student assessment, survey, and conclusions are included in this paper. The goal of this paper is to inspire and encourage a Statics 1 instructor to start using VR in their own course and then possibly consider expanding the VR technique to other mechanics concepts and major courses. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT), has been the solution adopted by many institutions, changing the traditional classes to a synchronous videoconference scheme with the support of online learning platforms. While ERT has been implemented as a temporary solution, from their application institutions can obtain valuable information about how to advance the digital transformation of the teaching and learning process after the pandemic ends. Some studies have found an increase in academic achievement in emergency remote teaching, partly explained by the combination of synchronous interaction with teachers and peers on videoconferences and chat rooms, and the benefits of asynchronous access to course materials that give the students the freedom to choose when to interact with the course material. Those findings suggests that further exploration of the benefits of this modality is needed. The evaluation of ERT characteristics and their comparison with traditional and blended models, may reveal insights about successful practices that can contribute to improve the learning experience and academic achievement of the students. In this study, we assess the learning experience of a sample of students from a first-year introductory programming course delivered using ERT modality using a validated learning experience instrument and analyze the data using factorial analysis to evaluate differences and similitudes on learning experience, academic achievement, and influence on first year student retention with similar courses delivered using other modalities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As the demand for online learning keeps growing in higher education, developing teaching pedagogies that are effective in online education is of importance. Teaching courses remotely involves challenges such as difficulties in retaining student attention and promoting collaborative in-class activities. These can adversely affect students' motivation for learning, comprehension of new concepts, and application of knowledge in realistic problems. In this study, the efficacy of flipped classroom pedagogy in online classes is investigated, with a focus on student engagement and learning outcomes. An undergraduate fluid mechanics course was reconstructed as an online flipped classroom; the student performance was compared to that of the previous in-person, non-flipped sections taught by the same instructor. The paper discusses three main design aspects in implementing an online flipped classroom: 1) syncing the material delivery paces with assignment deadlines, 2) multi-stage assignments on the same topic at incremental difficulty levels, and 3) web-friendly and well-defined deliverables for group problem-solving activities. In both sections offered as the flipped online classroom format in Fall 2021, remarkably high student participation was observed, with an average of 1.1 students absent out of 88 students throughout the semester. Furthermore, compared to the two previous in-person, non-flipped sections offered in Spring 2018 and Spring 2019, the online flipped classroom students earned a 3.5% higher average score on the same final exams. Overall, improvement in both student engagement and learning outcomes has been observed for the online flipped Fluid Mechanics course. Finally, the paper discusses the advantages, implementation strategies, and limitations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This evidence-based practice paper describes the implementation of competency-based learning in a course on the design of analog circuits. This implementation was motivated by two ideas. First, literature on competency-based learning and mastery-based learning suggests that these techniques improve student attitudes and learning, and this implementation sought to achieve these desirable outcomes. Second, the self-paced nature of competency-based learning helps to identify students that are learning material slowly, and this implementation sought to direct instructor resources to these students. However, the implementation was challenging because it needed to navigate the challenges of assessing students' mastery of content topics while bounding the amount of student and instructor time required for a demanding course. Competency-based learning was implemented using a flipped classroom format, where students watched web-based video lectures outside of class and participated in activities during class. The in-class activities included a team-based learning readiness assessment, followed by an opportunity to attempt a “mastery question” that allowed students to demonstrate that they had mastered course materials for the week. Performance on mastery questions was reviewed in a one-on-one conference with the course instructor. Grading on mastery questions was strictly pass/no-pass, and students were allowed unlimited attempts to pass mastery questions each week. 20% of a student's grade was determined by the number of mastery questions that they completed. These competency-based teaching methods were assessed by teaching the course twice, once using a lecture-based format and once using the competency-based techniques described above. In both offerings, the students completed the same set of exams and laboratory exercises, and the scores on the exams were used as quantitative measures of learning gains for the students. A short survey was used to gather additional quantitative measures of student attitudes about competency-based instruction. Finally, qualitative measures of student attitudes were extracted from student evaluations of teaching. A pre-test was used to assess whether students had prior experience with the course material. Students that received competency-based instruction scored higher on their exams on average. The average was increased because low scoring students receiving competency-based instruction achieved higher grades than low scoring students receiving lecture-based instruction. High scoring students achieved similar exam scores regardless of the style of instruction. In addition to learning more, students receiving competency-based instruction spent less time outside of class than students receiving lecture-based instruction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom is a relatively new pedagogical approach for student-centric learning. It is ushering in a new cohort of active learners. With the transition to remote education due to COVID-19, the flipped instruction style gained more popularity among instructors. But, since both instructors and students developed a feeling of increased workload, the adoption rate of flipped instruction in engineering courses has been slow. Research before the pandemic suggests that student learning is likely to improve in the flipped setup compared to the traditional classroom. However, there is still a need for more comprehensive studies to investigate the effectiveness of flipped pedagogy. This work studies the students' performance and perception of partial flipping in three machine learning classes. The modules from the first half of the semester were taught in a traditional fashion, and the modules in the second half of the semester were flipped. All of the course modules are of comparable difficulty. Thus, to measure the effectiveness of flipped instructions, we compared the homework and test scores from the modules studied in the first half of the semester to those from the second half of the semester where the flipped approach was used. No statistical difference in the scores was observed between the flipped and non-flipped modules. Nonetheless, 90% of the survey responses indicated that the video lectures helped them achieve the intended learning outcomes of the flipped modules. Besides scores, we used online surveys to gather student feedback and measure their perception of flipped learning. Content analysis of the survey responses showed a positive perception of the flipped instructions and the complementary in-class activities and elevated participation in class discussions despite some students' resistance to flipped learning. Also, flipping introduced flexibility on how the students first encounter the course contents. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

They subsequently reflected in writing about the use of these skills during their problem-solving efforts. Students exhibited consistent and earnest participation in the weekly reflections across the Fall 2021 semester. A structured content analysis of the reflections suggested the development of self-regulatory and self-managing behaviors for their academic and problem-solving pursuits. Specifically, when asked to evaluate their leanring points in week 8 from having completed the in-class exercises, the top four categories included Independent Effort, Application, or Problem-solving Skill (50%), Preparation & Feedback Gains (41%), and Carefulness, Organization & Diligence (30%). There was a statistically and practically-significant difference in the free-response scores in favor of the cohort that had received the metacognitive support (p < 0.0005; d = 0.97). With these questions, students had to demonstrate their problem-solving processes, which were a key component of the metacognitive instruction and weekly reflection questions. Thus, it's reasonable that there was an increase with the free-response questions versus the multiple-choice questions (necessarily). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It discusses the teaching strategies that have and haven't worked when delivering the course in both an online and hybrid approach. These include recommended durations for lecture videos, types of assessments, grade distributions, etc. Flipping the classroom was a result of the forced transition online due to Covid-19. To best support the students in the unprecedented times, the instructor opted to combine components from both asynchronous and synchronous teaching styles. Asynchronous lecture videos were accompanied by synchronous class time where the instructor clarified concepts, demonstrated real-life applications, solved higher-level problems, and implemented group activities. A combination of these active learning strategies was the key to structuring the course to keep the students engaged despite being online for all, or part, of the term as delivered in Fall 2020 and Fall 2021, respectively. In the Fall 2020 iteration, the course was delivered fully online to roughly 325 students in civil, environmental, geological, and architectural engineering. Since then, the course had been improved and adjusted in response to the students' feedback collected from an end-of-term survey. Approximately 270 students were enrolled in the course in the subsequent Fall 2021 term which took a hybrid approach as Covid-19 restrictions began to lighten. With students being able to learn in-person again, the course had shifted to emphasize student-to-student and student-to-instructor interactions. Feedback became immediate, allowing for the course to be molded to the students' satisfaction as the term progressed. Changes between the two years have been documented in the paper along with recommendations for future adaptations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This work-in-progress paper examines the relationship between students' preparation in flipped class and their learning. In engineering education, flipped course design is getting more attention among instructors of STEM courses. Flipped classroom model emphasizes student-centered learning, where much of students' learning is connected to their preparation before coming to the class using videos and other study material. As the model is highly dependent on students' self-preparation, it is crucial to capture the trends of students' preparation and its impact on students' learning for effective course design and continuous improvement. This study presents the preliminary results of an online flipped C++ programming course and evaluates the relationship between undergraduate students' class preparation and learning. Data were collected from 66 students for the whole semester, comprising 15 weeks. For preparation, students were encouraged to watch two videos for the flipped class: 1) description of programming construct and concept and 2) instructor emulation of a live coding session. For measuring students' class preparation, we recorded the video analytics indicating the time spent by each student to watch both videos respectively in each week. In addition, we used students' final scores in the course to measure students' learning and evaluated the relationship between students' class preparation and learning. Furthermore, we examined the trends of time spent on video watching for each week. Preliminary analysis was conducted using multiple regression and repeated measures ANOVA. The results indicate a significant relationship between students' preparation (time spent on videos) and their learning (final score). Further, the trends in repeated measures highlight the weeks where students spent the most time preparing. This work-in-progress paper relates the study results with the course design. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {One way to provide active learning is through the flipped classroom. However, finding suitable pre-class learning activities to improve student preparation and the subsequent classroom environment, including student engagement, can challenge the flipped modality. To address this challenge, adaptive learning lessons were developed for pre-class learning for a course in Numerical Methods. The lessons were then used as part of a research study to determine their cognitive and affective impacts. Thoughtful design and implementation of the adaptive lessons were completed prior to beginning the study. This paper discusses the development, implementation, refining, and revising of the adaptive learning platform (ALP) lessons for pre-class learning in a Numerical Methods flipped course. The paper also walks through the content of a typical lesson and shows the type of behavioral data collected by the adaptive learning platform by illustrating the interactions of three students of differing performance levels with a single lesson. In conjunction with the student's course grade, these interactions will be used in Fall 2022 to provide advice to struggling students about effective behaviors. The first author and two other instructors who teach Numerical Methods collaborated on developing the adaptive lessons for the whole course. The work began in Fall 2020 by enumerating the various chapters and breaking each one into 30 individual objectives (assignments), which were then divided into individual nodes (lessons). Each lesson includes five sections (introduction, learning objectives, video lectures, textbook content, assessment). The three instructors met twice a month to discuss the content that provides the basis for each of the lessons. The main discussion of the meetings centered on what a student would be expected to learn before coming to class, choosing appropriate content, agreeing on prerequisites, and choosing and making new assessment questions. Lessons were then created using a commercially available platform called RealizeIT. The content was tested by learning assistants and instructors. The adaptive lessons were completed in December 2020. The adaptive lessons were tested for implementation in Spring 2021 at the first author's university. Questions asked by students during office hours, on the LMS discussion board, and via emails while doing the lessons were used to update ALP content, clarify questions, and revise hints offered by the platform. The paper discusses the process of development, implementation, revision, and refinement of adaptive learning platform lessons for pre-class learning for a numerical methods course that is taught in the flipped modality. Three test cases are discussed to show how students interact with a typical ALP lesson. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This research aimed to explore different pedagogical methods for integrating software into engineering courses. This is a follow-up study to a preliminary study that was conducted during the previous semester on a quality control course. The preliminary study implemented two pedagogical methods: a traditional Instructor-Guided method and an active-learning Think-Pair-Share method. The study resulted in no statistically significant differences between the two methods. Therefore, for this study, we modified the traditional method, identified as Modified Instructor-Guided, and added two new active-learning methods, Flipped Classroom and Problem-Based Learning, in place of Think-Pair-Share. This study was conducted on an application focused statistics course, ESI3215C: Data Analysis for Industrial Applications. This is the first statistics course that students are required to take in the Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) program at the University of Florida. This course focuses on analysis of data encountered in ISE applications including system reliability, demand forecasting and inventory control, simulation, and quality control. Computational tools, specifically RStudio, are implemented to carry out various data analysis techniques. The first, modified pedagogical method is the Modified Instructor-Guided method in which the instructor conducts a cycle of mini-lectures and in-class exercises. The second pedagogical method is the Flipped Classroom method in which students watch short lecture videos before class and work in groups on in-class exercises. The third method is the Problem-Based Learning method in which the instructor presents a case study to be completed in groups to reach a solution, then conducts a mini-lecture at the conclusion of the case study. For each method, self-efficacy surveys and computational assessments were given to analyze student performance and comprehension. The results from this study indicate that Flipped Classroom and Modified Instructor-Guided outperform Problem-Based Learning in terms of computational understanding. However, Problem-Based Learning tends to result in higher RStudio self-efficacy, while Flipped Classroom tends to result in higher Theoretical and Statistical self-efficacy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Electronic packaging, as an emerging discipline, aims to cultivate professionals in electronic packaging technology. Electronic packaging technology is the core course of the electronic packaging, which involves multi-disciplinary fields such as materials, electronics, testing, design and manufacturing, and complicated operation skills, so the traditional teaching model can no longer meet the needs of experimental teaching and talent training due to the disadvantages of low efficiency and high repeatability. With the development of Internet technology and the integration of computer technology and education, flipped classroom teaching model has attracted much attention in higher education. The application of the flipped classroom strategy in other engineering education has brought about beneficial gains in teaching effect. However, the use of flipped classroom strategy in the experimental teaching of electronic packaging technology has received less attention. The purpose of this study is to identify the impact of flipped classroom teaching model in the experimental teaching of electronic packaging technology. In this study, the flipped classroom teaching model was introduced in the experimental teaching of the electronic packaging technology. At the same time, the teaching content was designed with modular and the teaching concept of outcome-based education (OBE) was also integrated into the teaching course. The results showed that the efficiency and quality of experimental teaching have been effectively improved by the construction of online learning tutorials, independent learning pre-class, collaborative practice in-class and knowledge consolidation post-class. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Additionally, as economic resources are generally limited, it is sought to avoid investing large sums of money in software and hardware, as well as in fitting out laboratories. This work presents a didactic proposal within the framework of active and collaborative learning that includes the flipped classroom technique to be applied in the curriculum of undergraduate engineering programs and inside a massive flexible digital master class. The activity is the mathematical modeling, simulation, and control system of a direct current motor where simulation work is carried out in open license computational packages. Students understand the physical phenomena involved in the motor’s modeling and the input–output variables’ relations. Moreover, an analogy between an electromechanical and a pure electrical model is carried out, where the relevant variables respond in an agile and reliable manner. To validate the modeling, the differential equations are solved by applying numerical methods, and tested for control purposes. The activity has been validated with a rule-based system applied to a Likert scale survey data. This type of human–computer interaction, in the context of active learning, could engage students and motivate them to develop competencies that are highly appreciated by industry practitioners. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Two core courses have been given for several years to senior chemical engineering undergraduate students in flipped format, combining pre-class online preparation by the students, “class meetings” with the lecturer, and “active tutorials,” in which groups of students solve exercises. In 2020/21, the COVID-19 lockdown imposed online teaching of these courses to the 54 enrolled students. The objective of work presented in this paper is to explore the impact of the remote flipped classroom design on students' learning experience and achievements, in comparison to the regular flipped class in which only the first preparation phase was online. Because the course was taught completely online, a plethora of data was for the first time made available to support a thorough study of the course teaching protocol, including data from Panopto Analytics®, Zoom and Moodle logs, extensive self-report surveys, as well as actual learning outcomes (exam results). Statistical analyses including multivariate regression were performed to determine which factors most affect learning outcomes. The student surveys indicate that of the three class steps, the “active tutorial” gives students the most confidence in their mastery. Furthermore, analysis indicates that active students think that they benefit more than do passive students, as reflected by both self-reporting and final exam performances. The importance of underlying ability, as indicated by the GPA is a principal conclusion from the regression model, which also identifies attendance of “active tutorials” as a dominant positive effect on exam grades. Two important conclusions of our work are that the online and face-to-face versions of our flipped approach achieve indistinguishable learning outcomes and that students’ perceived confidence in their mastery is highest after the active tutorial. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Although both commercial and do-it-yourself designs of lightboards are currently available, we have conducted a student-led engineering research and design project to optimize a lightboard design for broader use on campus to enhance the learning of future students. Through systematic side-by-side comparison, the team determined that Starphire Ultra-Clear™ glass is more appropriate than standard window glass for larger lightboard designs, despite its higher cost. The fully built and validated solution is housed in the campus Library for broad implementation into classroom environments throughout all institution outlets. The effectiveness of the lightboard is evaluated through a student comparison of short online videos generated using three separate formats: narrated slides, whiteboard, and the new lightboard. Students in a hybrid in-person and online class favored having the instructor facing the camera (76%), hand-written content (64%), and the use of more advanced technology (67%). Furthermore, through a pairwise polling comparison, students consistently favored the lightboard over narrated slides or simple whiteboard presentation formats. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The paper compares the effectiveness of in-person and virtual engineering laboratory sessions. The in-person and virtual laboratory sessions reported here comprise six experiments combined with short tutorials. The virtual lab combined enquiry-based learning and gamification principles. The integration of the virtual labs with in-person teaching created a blended learning environment. The effectiveness of this approach was assessed based on (i) the student feedback (i.e., a questionnaire with open-ended questions and Likert scale feedback), (ii) the students' engagement with the virtual lab, and (iii) the impact on the academic performance (i.e., class test results). The students reported greater confidence in the understanding of theory in the virtual lab than the in-person lab. This is interesting given that the instruction for the virtual lab and the in-person lab of one experiment is identical (i.e., same instructor, same enquiry-based learning techniques, and same explanations). The students also appreciated the ability to complete the virtual lab anytime, anywhere, for as long as they needed, and highlighted the benefits of the interactivity. The median class test scores of the students who completed some or all the virtual lab experiments was higher than those who did not (83–89% vs. 67%). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flipped instruction in an undergraduate numerical methods course in the online, remote environment during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted with and without the use of adaptive-learning lessons for pre-class preparation. This comparison was made to explore potential differences with and without adaptive software relative to exam and concept inventory performance and student perceptions of the classroom environment, learning and motivation, and benefits and drawbacks. Student perceptions were gathered via the College and University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI) and a survey designed to capture feedback specific to flipped instruction. The analysis was made possible by a current NSF grant to study adaptive learning in the flipped classroom at three universities and extensive prior research with the flipped classroom and adaptive learning by the authors. Results gathered in the online flipped classroom with adaptive learning suggested positive changes in the following: classroom environmental perceptions, preference for flipped instruction, perceived responsibility imposed, motivation for independent learning, and perceived learning. Furthermore, based on an open-ended question, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of students who experienced load, burden, or stressors in the online flipped classroom when adaptive learning was available versus not. Multiple-choice exam and concept-inventory results were slightly higher with adaptive lessons (although not significantly so), with the most promising results occurring for Pell grant recipients. The emerging medical education literature has suggested that adaptive learning and flipped instruction will be key to post-pandemic education. The present article begins advocacy for adaptive learning with flipped instruction in engineering education. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In OBE, different types of active learning tools, varying from a simple, class room assessment tools like one-minute paper, thinkpair-share, flipped classroom, to a more complex technique like problem based learning, cooperative learning, peer supported independent study are used so that the engineering graduates get equipped with required skill sets to make them industry ready. In India, nowadays the quality of education provided by the institutions and the programs run by these institutions is evaluated by two major bodies namely NBA and NAAC. Accreditation of the programs and institutions by NBA and NAAC is based on some criteria and it has become an essential requirement to ensure the quality technical education. In NBA and NAAC, students’ placements, higher education, entrepreneurship, industry internship and connect with industry are considered to be the key indicators for ensuring quality technical education and a higher weightage has been provided in the evaluation process. In this paper, an attempt has been done to improve students’ placement index (i.e. placements, higher studies and entrepreneurships) by implementing the concept of Quality Circle (QC) activity for the students of civil engineering department of Rajarambapu Institute of Technology, Rajaramnagar. The results indicate that implementation of QC concept could improve placement index by 10% for last two batches and could maintain progress even during COVID pandemic. Thus, study concludes that implementation of QC concept helps in enhancing placement index of department. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We have implemented a methodology for using short videos as a part of a flipped classroom design in an introductory, multi-campus physics course for engineering students. These pre-recorded videos introduced theory and concepts to students ahead of in-class sessions, which enabled a reduction in the time used for traditional lectures. The time spent in classes puts emphasis on student activities, such as quizzes, Q&A sessions with the lecturer answering student-submitted questions, and problem solving. The physics course has a modular design for customized delivery to a multitude of study programmes and is coordinated by a team of teachers who provide localized classes at several campuses. Although teachers manage individual classes, the course uses an open learning environment which allows enrolled students access to all study materials published by any teacher. We present results from a questionnaire investigating student experiences with the use of short videos, by measuring the overall level of satisfaction with the videos, as well as collecting students' comments to the videos. We investigate correlations between student satisfaction with the videos and the comments they make, and whether students whose teacher is featured in the video are more satisfied than students without a personal relationship with the featured teacher. Students report overall satisfaction with video length and level of precision, while requesting more worked examples and detailed calculations. We identify a set of good practices for flipped classroom designs, based on the students' feedback. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Solving design problems is a core activity in the engineering field. Design teaching is often project based and follows a cycle from idea to implementation, which perfectly fits the Conceive Design Implement Operate (CDIO) approach. However, it is challenging to design teaching using problems that resemble those found in real engineering practice in a single course. Real problems are typically complex and multidisciplinary, requiring the course to cover both the general design content and the content from each specific discipline. Indeed, to support their work during the design process, the diverse engineering disciplines use different tools and techniques, which must be effectively combined. This multidisciplinary content must also be meaningfully linked and delivered in a way that prevents students from losing their interest when dealing with content from a different discipline. This paper proposes an approach to solve this challenge, which combines gamification and just-in-time learning in a flipped-classroom and project-based learning setting. The gamified project creates a scenario (set of specific tasks/problems) for the just-in-time pulling of learning content, which is made available online. The students learn as needed to play the game in class and are assessed according to their reflections on their game choices and results, rather than whether they win or lose the game. This paper explains the proposed approach's background, describes its gamification elements and dynamics, shows its use in a mechanical engineering master's course intervention, and reflects on the results from the intervention implementation. The students' feedback shows that the approach was able to bring awareness on how the different engineering disciplines contribute to the design problem solution while keeping the students motivated and engaged in the course's activities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Due to the maintenance of the COVID-19 pandemic in the year 2021 due to the emergence of some variants, some universities around the world, especially in countries with a still high transmission rate, decided to continue with remote classes in this academic period. In this context, Software Testing is an important topic of knowledge derived from Software Engineering and has been gaining prominence in development companies in recent years, however it is a subject that needs a more practical and dynamic way of learning to obtain skills and competences. by the students. In order to promote a good teaching and learning process, more and more teachers and professors have been taking greater care in the selection of teaching strategies to help build the knowledge of their students, one of these strategies is the flipped classroom, in which the student internalizes the contents pointed out before a class and then, together with the class, a discussion is held about the knowledge acquired with the help and guidance of the teacher / professor. However, this knowledge transfer process has some extra difficulties with content that are more easily taught in a practical and face-to-face manner. Assuming, this work presents how the authors got around these difficulties and what the students present in a graduate class in a Software Testing subject thought of the adopted teaching strategy. To present an experience report of the use of the flipped classroom strategy in a software testing subject in a graduate computer science class. In parallel also, analyze the motivation and engagement of students in this learning scenario of the strategy in remote teaching. For this subject, a specific curriculum was selected for the teaching of software testing that takes into account the academic competences of the Brazilian Ministry of Education - MEC. Both the learning of the content were evaluated, taking into account the evaluations that were used in the flipped classroom with other teaching strategies in two other previous classes, the feedback given by the students about the subject and specifically about this teaching strategy was also considered, which was obtained via a structured questionnaire answered anonymously by each of the students participating in the course. The results indicate that there was an increase in the students' grade compared to evaluations of the same subject in the two previous years. However, the most important result was the feedback given by the students in the perception questionnaire of each teaching strategy adopted in the subject, considering that there was an excellent acceptance according to the participants.

	abstract = {This Research to Practice Full Paper presented a comprehensive experiment approach to enhancing computer engineering ability. This approach integrated Swift programming language, iOS development, UML, software testing, MVC, Cocoa Touch Framework and Design Patterns into a comprehensive experiment, through which students can master the engineering methods to solve complex application problems.In college, traditional computer programming courses focus on the grammar and classical algorithm of programming language. Usually the amount of code is far lower than that of industrial products. Such programming courses can't effectively improve students' ability to solve complex engineering problems. They also can't meet the requirements of industrial development. Students are not satisfied with the results of these courses. There is an intense need for the studies of enhancing student's computer engineering ability.Taking Swift Language Programming course as an example, this paper presented a comprehensive experiment approach to enhancing students' computer engineering ability by developing classic industrial iOS Apps.Flipped classroom pedagogy is conducive to free much time in class. Lecturers can fully communicate with students and help students complete challenging tasks. The comprehensive experiment consists of pre-class activities and in-class activities. Before class, the lecturer provides experiment materials online including theoretical handouts of Design Patterns, manuals of UML 2.0 specifications and Cocoa Touch reference manual, etc. Students learn the materials by themselves, practice and discuss online and complete the corresponding pre-class tests. In class, the lecturer analyzes in detail the problems students encounter after class and guides them to solve these problems. The lecturer also participates in each group discussion to ensure the smooth progress of students' project.The implementation of comprehensive experiment is divided into four sub tasks. These tasks are app function analysis, App detailed design, programming implementation, and App release and launch. First, according to the requirements of the App, the function is analyzed in detail and defined with UML. Second, based on functional analysis, the App's system architecture, data structure, view combination, logic execution process and core algorithms are designed. The system is defined in detail with UML Class diagram. Third, according to the detailed design of the App, user interface is built by Xcode storyboard, and the model layer, view layer and control layer are implemented in Swift. Then unit test and system test are conducted on the App and bugs are repaired. Finally, App launch is completed including App internationalization, developer certificate applying, creating description file, setting product identification and deployment information, and submitting App online.To assess the effect of this comprehensive experiment approach, three-year teaching data were analyzed using statistical methods. The results show that students' engineering ability (measured by code scale) and student satisfaction (measured by questionnaires) were significantly improved.Our contribution is to propose a detailed comprehensive experiment approach to enhancing computer engineering ability. The analysis of teaching data show that it is helpful to improve students' computer engineering ability and course satisfaction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Shifting to remote learning we made faster and deeper the methodological and technical changes in the teaching-learning process designed before pandemic. Both were based on the digital transformation of education and efforts to reform engineering education in Argentina: in order to meet the demands of this dynamic world, engineering programs are challenged to find innovative ways to teach classes so that graduates are prepared in soft skills as well as technical skills. The UNSJ Distance Education System made the Moodle platform immediately and massively available. This allowed us to make an abrupt transformation of the learning space. We use the flipped classroom method, design activities to promote transversal skills and modify the forms of evaluation. In response, the students have shown a strong commitment to the proposal, an important responsibility in group activities and a very good connection with virtual tools. In the post-pandemic we will opt a blend learning, to enhance the benefits of online and face-to-face teaching and tend to design a student-centered learning methodology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We concentrate on a single class session in which we bracketed brief moments of focus on the perception of sounds and smells to foster ecological attunement, prioritizing students’ embodied and local knowledge. By analyzing the resulting observations and discussions, we describe how the timed exercises activated intervals of possibility for ecological connection, registered through expressions of curiosity and wonder, where a spectrum of imaginative potential emerged. In the findings, we also discuss unexpected tensions that emerged between the educators’ desire to manage classroom behavior and generate identifiable data while also intending to embrace ambiguity in a playful and imaginative atmosphere. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study provides an insight into the needs of students in adjusting to online teaching. This study presents the methodological design of the course “Industrial Hygiene I,” part of a technology-based engineering bachelor’s degree from Universidad Católica del Norte (Chile). Once the theoretical framework was established, three surveys were designed throughout the course to measure students’ perceptions of the access, use, and utility of digital tools used in online teaching during the pandemic. Thirty-five students participated in this quantitative study. Following a data analysis, it was observed that 46% of students use their cell phones to access virtual classes and more than 50% are dissatisfied with the internet connection; therefore, it was necessary to adapt the learning methodology. After that, more than 50% of the students said that they preferred a flipped classroom over traditional methodology. In addition, the quality of the course was not affected by using the internet (60%), and the methodology generates advantages in terms of learning (72%). These findings have several implications in both the design of different subjects in the engineering degree and the practice of different learning methods. Future hybrid teaching designs require taking up the challenges of both improving technology-supported teaching and assessing competence in the same context. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In addition, the schedule of this course is from 15 to 17 h, just after lunchtime. This causes a decrease in the attendance and motivation of the students throughout the course. To mitigate this problem, an Active Learning methodology was proposed. Personal response systems are mechanisms with a system of controls that, in real time, can be used to carry out questionnaires and interpret the results. One of these systems is the platform Kahoot!. The materials of each lesson were provided to the students so that they could work on the contents before the sessions (flipped classroom). A quiz is completed before and after each session to determine the degree of involvement of the students and the level of attention during the session. The first and last 5-10 minutes of each of the theory sessions were dedicated to the Kahoot! quizzes. Most of the students' connections were made with their mobile phones. The results show that the level of student engagement increases over the course, as the percentage of correct answers before the explanation increases over the course. It is also observed that after the lessons, the rate of correct answers increases, which indicates that the students are more involved and follow the class with greater interest than previously. Moreover, gamification improves the classroom learning atmosphere. The use of Kahoot! to promote active learning, to reinforce the knowledge of the concepts seen in class and to create an evaluative test in the form of a game were evaluated in a very positive way. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Therefore, gender equity in STEM fields has also become part of the goals of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, with the aim of building a less exclusionary world. Faced with this urgent need to design a more inclusive future, several approaches have been proposed to attract girls to the exact sciences and engineering using active learning strategies and valuing the protagonism of these students in their school environment. In order to do so, a group of six ninth grade girls were invited to participate in the pilot project Accelerating Girls in Elementary School, conducted by undergraduate students in the exact sciences and engineering, and accompanied by professors from the school and from the University of Brasilia. In it, the Elementary School students were organized into a team to propose and present STEM hands-on practices, according to curricular contents, to their own class. The steps for designing such activities include weekly meetings for the development of the flipped classroom, quizzes and hands-on activities. Aspects and outcomes related to this process are described and discussed based on the literature, motivating reflections on strategies used to develop skills and competencies in STEM with young girls. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In particular, it considers how the collaborative setting of in-class group-work affect the female population of students. The paper draws on an in-depth analysis of the interview with one such student. The focus of this interview was on interactional collaboration between peers during group work activities in a mathematics course. Such work is vital in a flipped classroom arrangement. The student, called Sofia, highlighted arguments of value for a deeper investigation. The analysis draws on Bjerrum Nielsen’s framework with four different gender perspectives (2003). Our analysis illuminates a number of arguments about interactions and interpretations of gender and challenges when collaborating in groups in a flipped classroom setting. Arguments informs both context and individual levels of the setting. What is realised in the case of Sofia is that there are dualistic viewpoints raised within all gender perspectives, sometimes conflicting each other. Result is that guidance from a teacher in formation of groups is necessary but will need careful considerations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The paper considers the practical application of flipped classroom methodology to training engineering master students. The paper presents the results of the pedagogical experiment conducted in classes with master students majoring in oil and gas industry. The experiment aims to propose the efficient methods of acquiring and developing the key language competences through the flipped/inverted classroom approach. The paper covers the academic achievements and possible drawbacks of the applied methodology in training engineering students. The research included several stages revealing the level of student satisfaction and self-reported progress prior and after the experiment. The short-term outcomes clearly indicate the flipped classroom efficiency and increased engagement while the long-term results can lead to self-motivated pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons. The formative and summative assessment demonstrated a significant increase in students’ academic achievements while promoting their engagement in the education process. The attempt of introducing lifelong learning idea in language classes within tertiary education is implemented. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {During the past decade, the number of teachers trying to use active methods such as the Flipped Class model in teaching foreign languages has increased significantly. However, little research has been carried out to determine the effectiveness of Flipped Class at a Technical University while teaching English. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the effectiveness of teaching English for engineering students in a Flipped Class course. Limited classroom time, lack of modern teaching materials, mixed-ability classrooms in nowadays universities made the study urgent. Two groups of Master’s students of Moscow State Power Engineering Institute were taught English using different methods: one group (N = 19) was taught in a traditional classroom, while for the second group (N = 20) a teaching method was based on the principles of Flipped Class using I-net resources along with traditional textbooks. The resources such as TED talks, TEDEd, smartphone applications for language learning, and others were included. Both groups were assessed in the same way after a ten-week period. Questionaries, language tests, observations were used in the course of our research. The analysis of the results obtained proves the efficiency of a Flipped Class Model in all aspects of assessment. Besides, the perception questionary shows the second group students’ motivation towards English learning increased to a great extent. Students became involved, and the Flipped Class Model encouraged communication and collaboration. The outcomes of the study suggest the implementation of Flipped class technology can be recommended for at least some part of an English teaching course. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose This research aims to describe layering of career-like experiences over existing curriculum to improve perceived educational value. Background Feedback from students and regional businesses showed a clear need to increase student’s exposure to career-like software development projects. The initial goal was to develop an instructor-optional project that could be used in a single mid-level programming course; however, the pilot quickly morphed into a multi-year study examining the feasibility of agile projects in a variety of settings. Methodology Over the course of four years, an agile project was honed through repeated De-sign Based Research (DBR) cycles of design, implementation, testing, commu-nication, and reflective analysis. As is common with DBR, this study did not fol-low single methodology design; instead, analysis of data coupled with review of literature led to exploration and testing of a variety of methodologies. The review phase of each cycle included examination of best practices and methodol-ogies as determined by analysis of oral and written comments, weekly journals, instructor feedback, and surveys. As a result of participant feedback, the original project was expanded to a second project, which was tested in another Software Engineering (SE) course. The project included review and testing of many academic and professional methodologies, such as Student Ownership of Learning, Flipped Classroom, active learning, waterfall, agile, Scrum, and Kan-ban. The study was homogenous and quasi-experimental as the population consisted solely of software engineering majors taking required courses; as based on validity of homogenous studies, class sizes were small, ranging from 8 to 20 stu-dents. Close interactions between respondents and the instructor provided interview-like settings and immersive data capture in a natural environment. Further, the iterative development practices of DBR cycles, along with the inclu-sion of participants as active and valued stakeholders, was seen to align well with software development practitioner practices broadly known as agile. Contribution This study is among the first to examine layering a career-like software develop-ment project on top of a course through alteration of traditional delivery, agile development, and without supplanting existing material. Findings In response to industry recommendations for additional career-like experiences, a standalone agile capstone-like project was designed that could be layered over an existing course. Pilot data reflected positive perceptions of the project, although students did not have enough time to develop a working prototype in ad-dition to completing existing course materials. Participant feedback led to simultaneous development of a second, similar project. DBR examination of both projects resulted in a simplified design and the ability to develop a working prototype, if and only if the instructor was willing to make adjustments to delivery. After four years, a solution was developed that is both stable and flexible. The solution met the original charge in that it required course delivery, not course material, to be adjusted. It is critical to note that when a working prototype is desired, a portion of the lecture should be flipped allowing more time for guided instruction through project-focused active learning and study group requirements. The results support agile for standalone software development pro-jects, as long as passive delivery methods are correspondingly reduced. Recommendations for Practitioners Based on the findings, implementation of a career-like software development project can be well received as long as active learning components are also developed. Multiple cycles of DBR are recommended if future researchers wish to customize instructional delivery and develop complex software development projects. Programming instructors are recommended to explore hybrid delivery to support development of agile career-like experiences. Small class sizes allowed the researchers to maintain an interview-like setting throughout the study and future studies with larger classes are recommended to include additional subject matter experts such as graduate students as interaction with a subject matter expert was highly valued by students. Recommendations for Researchers Researchers are recommended to further examine career-like software develop-ment experiences that combine active learning with agile methods; more studies following agile and active learning are needed to address the challenges faced when complex software development is taught in academic settings. Further testing of standalone agile project development has now occurred in medium sized in person classes, online classes, independent studies, and creative works research settings; however, further research is needed. Future research should also examine the implementation of agile projects in larger class sizes. Increasing class size should be coupled with additional subject matter experts such as graduate students. Impact on Society This study addresses professional recommendations for development of agile career-like experiences at the undergraduate level. This study provides empirical evidence of programming projects that can be layered over existing curriculum, with no additional cost to the students Initial feedback from local businesses and graduates, regarding agile projects with active learning, has been positive. The area business that refused to hire our underprepared SE graduates has now hired several. Future Research Future research should explore layering agile projects over a broader range of software development courses. Feedback from hiring professionals and former students has been positive. It is also recommended that DBR be used to de-velop career-like experiences for online programming courses © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to present the best practices, according to the perception of students, applied during the lock down terms as well as introducing a model that can be applied after the pandemic when students return to campuses gradually, especially in countries like ours where still not all students are on campus as of fall of 2021. In some countries the vaccination efforts are slow and universities will continue to rely on online teaching if not for all, for some courses. This model adapts for either full face to face classes or fully online or hybrid classes. Results show that there are important lessons or things that the lock-down left to universities and educators, and as students confirm their will to continue to have some of their courses in the online format, universities should consider not closing the option of online teaching. The model presented in this paper also takes into account students' comments and recommendations about the future implementations of online courses and what they would like to see in them, even if they are going to be on campus. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {At present Russia forms a new education system focused on entering into the world’s information and educational space. The article reveals the relationship between the emergence of innovative forms of student’s education and the quality of their mastering of both professional competencies and soft skills. It also describes the mutual influence of education using a digital educational platform and interactive teaching methods (such as flipped classroom, mind maps, case studies). We also used questioning and testing of students who completed the above described course. The analysis and comparison of the results of education with the use of 3 variants of approach was done: 1. the use of digital educational platform, 2. the use of innovative teaching methods, and 3. digital educational platform and innovative methods combined together. We have concluded that the most effective education model is the combination of traditional classes with the introduction of innovative methods and digitalization of education. This method allows you to keep all the advantages of face-to-face communication between students and the lecturer, stimulates creative thinking and gives an opportunity for individual time planning due to offline digital technologies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Higher Education has gone through a process of reframing its pedagogical processes, because at the same time the traditional concept of teaching can no longer be accepted, since it considers that the student is not part of the construction and development of knowledge, but only a spectator of the teacher. Currently, active methodologies stand out, as they seek to stimulate students' professional practical learning. This article aims to present how Knowledge Management (KM) practices and tools can be integrated in the planning of a sequence of classes that follows the proposal of Inverted Classroom based on Problems and Orientation through Project. The methodology adopted is of an applied nature with a qualitative approach, with exploratory bibliographical research and case study being carried out in a discipline of Software Engineering course in the face-to-face modality. Data collection was developed through a documentary study of the record of the teacher's classes. The content analysis allowed us to verify the facilities and difficulties of applying the proposed lesson planning. This article demonstrates that the inverted classroom proposal applying PBL and OMP with KM practices and tools can be a pedagogical proposal that allows the KM cycle to occur between students and teachers, both in the classroom and in the virtual mode. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Transferring the up-to-date knowledge to the students may change over time although core topics remain the same. This paper aims to attract attention to the need for change to obtain a well-prepared course content that combines theory and practice. For this purpose, the study is structured in two phases. In the first phase, teaching and grading activities for an Industrial Engineering undergraduate course is considered for nine years period. Statistical analysis confirm that workshop sessions have a positive effect on students’ success. To identify the overall learning experience during the course and the awareness of flipped classrooms, a feedback questionnaire is conducted in the second phase. The questionnaire results verify that students can benefit from audio-visual course materials that are shared with them before the class. Case discussions and hands-on practices may be helpful to increase the success of undergraduate engineering students for courses like Manufacturing Processes. However, strict health-safety regulations and unexpected occasions such as pandemics may restrict hands-on learning. Learning environments equipped with new technologies can replace traditional methods soon when it is not possible to conduct such training physically. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {University education has experienced an increase in the use of ICT-related tools, to some extent driven by the pandemic situation that occurred during the past academic years 2019/20 and 2020/21. Face-to-face small group practices that required the use of specific equipment by students have been relegated to other types of activities that allow keeping an adequate distance between individuals. At this point, active methodologies acquire a fundamental role for large group virtual theoretical classes, when having to keep focussed for one hour and a half on the traditional masterful method, thus becoming a true challenge. This paper presents the work carried out to complement the teaching of the subject Graphic Engineering and Topography, and more precisely, in the area related to topographic levelling to incorporate the flipped classroom model as a pilot experience in some topics. The follow-up of this experience has been performed by means of activity reports and a satisfaction survey. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom is an emerging strategy for the delivery of technical threshold content within tertiary engineering programs. In this study, we measure the effect that the approach has on the immediate and ongoing academic success of four cohorts of engineering dynamics students in New Zealand. Two cohorts (N = 865) received traditional lectures and two cohorts (N = 123) received a flipped classroom delivery. Both the Wilcoxon ranksum and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests noted a lack of significant contrasts across the performance in the first year dynamics class due to the teaching approach used (p > 0.05). In a follow-on dynamics class, N = 303 students previously undertook traditional lectures and N = 35 previously undertook flipped classrooms. When follow-on marks were compared across groups, there were no statistically significant differences observed across those that took the foundational class via traditional or flipped teaching approaches. This outcome implies that the flipped approach has a negligible effect on student academic achievement. However, these outcomes must be considered in context of the qualitative benefits of the flipped classroom approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flipped classrooms are increasingly popular due to improvements in online technology and expected benefits in student engagement and learning. Although research has increased dramatically in the last 10 years, few studies have assessed the effectiveness of flipping large enrollment, barrier mathematics courses. Creating a comprehensive flipped classroom learning experience that includes high quality in-class activities can be particularly challenging in large classrooms, especially when implemented for the first time. However, improving engagement and learning in these courses would be particularly helpful in improving STEM graduation rates. This paper describes a longitudinal analysis of student performance and opinions in a differential equations course over three years with three different instructional strategies: traditional lecture, initial flipped, and revised flipped. We found that flipping the course reduced withdrawal rates and improved pass rates, but the initial iteration reduced exam performance. We then observed a positive change in exam performance and student opinion from the initial to the revised flipped course. We conclude that the flipped classroom can be effective in large mathematics courses required for STEM degrees, although it may not be possible to see all benefits in an initial implementation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As the COVID-19 pandemic forced a sudden shift to online teaching and learning in April 2020, one of the more significant challenges faced by instructors is encouraging and maintaining student engagement in their online classes. This paper describes my experience of flipping an online classroom for a core Chemical Engineering Fluid Mechanics class to promote student engagement and collaboration in an online setting. Comparing exam scores with prior semesters involving in-person, traditional lecture-style classes suggests that students need a certain degree of adjustment to adapt to this new learning mode. A decrease in student rating of teaching (SRT) scores indicates that students largely prefer in-person, traditional lectures over an online flipped class, even though written comments in the SRT contained several responses favorable to flipping the class in an online setting. Overall, SRT scores on a department level also showed a similar decrease, which suggests students were less satisfied with the quality of teaching overall throughout the department, with this flipped method of instruction neither improving nor worsening student sentiment toward online learning. In addition, whereas most students liked the prerecorded lecture videos, they were less enthusiastic about using breakout rooms to encourage student collaboration and discussion. Further thought and discussion on best practices to facilitate online student interaction and collaboration are recommended, as online learning will likely continue to grow in popularity even when in-person instruction resumes after the pandemic. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The challenge of teaching FE is delivering meaningful learning outcomes to the different backgrounds, motivations, and interests of the audiences. This article delves into the origins of FE in academia and the influence on teaching of an expanding food processing industry. Current trends demand a FE education with a wider scope, focused on consumer needs and wants that convey elements of food product design, sustainability, innovation, and culinary applications, among others. Although the core concepts of FE have remained practically the same, new teaching methodologies call for expanded computational abilities, ample access to online contents, and active learning, student-centered approaches. As a case study, we describe the implementation of an elective flipped classroom course on engineering, science, and gastronomy for undergraduate students that include in-class demonstrations by chefs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Mathematics is an important topic for computing and engineering students, but students often find the subject challenging, which emphasises the importance of using effective pedagogical strategies. The constructivist approach of the flipped classroom, where students learn new content out of class, and practice problems and engage in discussion in class, is raising in popularity. However, it is seldom reported how such an approach is used for teaching mathematics in the context of computing courses. This paper reports the experience and findings of implementing a flipped classroom approach for a foundation university module titled Mathematics for Technology'. A flipped classroom approach is shown to be successful in this context, but there are key considerations for its implementation. This includes factors such as constructive alignment, the desired learning and assessment outcomes, and the disposition of the student cohort. Recommendations are provided for practitioners who may be interested in implementing the flipped classroom approach in a similar context. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses, undergraduate laboratory classes are vital for students to develop competencies such as critical observation, collaboration, critical thinking, technical, and problem-solving skills. Thus, for students to successfully acquire these competencies, preparation for laboratory classes is essential. This study aimed to explore the students' performance and perceptions of online pre-laboratory videos and quizzes in undergraduate food science and technology. Quantitative data on student usage statistics of the videos, student performance in online quizzes and practical reports scores and student perceptions were analysed to provide a detailed perspective of the course. The students' performance was above 60% in all pre-lab quizzes for both the 2018 and 2019 cohorts. The average pre-lab video views were higher in the 2019 cohorts compared to the 2018 cohort. The majority of the students felt that the topics were well explained in the videos (M = 4.25 ± 0.84) and it was easy to learn from the videos (M = 4.31 ± 0.76). In terms of students perceptions, a strong positive correlations were found between course organisation and motivation and self-efficacy (r = 0.86, p < 0.05); course engagement and motivation and self-efficacy (r = 0.82, p < 0.05). The strongest positive correlation was between course organisation and online engagement (r = 0.95, p < 0.05). The results of this study suggest that the introduction of multimodal/digital preparation resources (pre-lab videos and online quizzes) was positively received and benefited the students. Students have engaged enthusiastically with these resources and completed the majority of the tasks set. These findings will further expand research directed towards student perception of the lab experience and aid in the adaptation of food science and technology curriculums to accommodate both student and university needs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We present the design and implementation of a blended learning environment where fundamental concepts belonging to a flipped classroom paradigm are applied to a project-based learning module. Several in-class and out-class activities are employed pivoting on the objective of improving students’ learning experiences in an engineering project-connected curriculum. The key idea of this pedagogy study is to structure most of the theoretical aspects of the subject matter in pre-recorded video lectures, online media platforms, learning materials and quizzes. For students exposed to the hybrid Project-Based Learning–Flipped Classroom pedagogy, it is mandatory for them to watch the video lectures and partake the online quizzes before coming to class. Accordingly, studio classes are not spent covering theories, instead time is spent on discussions and small-scale engineering demonstrations so that students have better perspectives on the actual application of theories. We compared results from two classes of students – one is subjected to a traditional project-based learning while the other undergoes a hybrid Project-Based Learning–Flipped Classroom. Key findings have indicated a significant increase in fundamental formative knowledge, enhanced problem-solving abilities and production of better performing artefacts with regard to the set of design skills for students undergoing hybrid Project-Based Learning–Flipped Classroom. Survey results further highlighted that Project-Based Learning–Flipped Classroom students were highly positive towards achieving better project outcomes and are able to think critically in developing creative artefacts. As a result, these Project-Based Learning–Flipped Classroom students are more active in their learning process. This study provides a reference platform for educators who are seeking new directions in learning/facilitating strategies that complement existing methods in order to enrich the project-based learning experience of students. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In this context, this research reports how we combined two active methodologies in Software Engineering Emergency Remote Teaching. Objective. Therefore, this study aims to report the experiences obtained from the application of gamified study guides in Software Engineering (SE) between November 2020 and April 2021. Method. We combined flipped classroom, an active methodology already known by them, with Gamification to improve students' acceptance and engagement. We created six gamified study guides for the SE flipped classes. 51 students participated in the classes, 12 students from the Computer Technician course and 39 students from the Computer Science Bachelor course. Each study guide had a group of checkpoints to organize the content in levels. Results. At the end of the application, we observed 83.6% of the participating students maintained their engagement. According to self-declaration, 85% felt motivated by the approach adopted, with 75.9% considering that the class format presented enhanced their learning. We also observed a positive impact on learning gain in an average of 18.3% in their grades. Final Considerations. We concluded that using Gamification and Flipped Classroom has positive impacts on learning and acceptance, although the COVID-19 pandemic and the ERT negatively affect students' motivation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The potential influence of the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the status of school education and further accelerated the revolution of regular teaching method. This study compared the learning effectiveness and learning strategies of vocational high school students in flipped teaching and traditional teaching modes. By adopting flipped teaching on an electronics course throughout the entire academic year, this study aimed to explore the effect of learning strategies of the students under flipped teaching. The subjects of this study were 85 sophomore students majoring in Electrical Engineering. This study randomly selected one class as the control group (n = 43), and adopted the regular teaching method while another class was selected as the experimental group (n = 42), and employed the flipped teaching method. This study used the “Learning strategy scale of students in vocational high schools” as the instrument. The students’ scores of the Testing Center for Technological and Vocational Education Test were used to evaluate their learning effectiveness. The results of this study indicate that students under the flipped teaching model made remarkable progress in the electronics course and the learning outcomes remained significant after a long period of time. Moreover, they made notable changes in their learning strategies, including “learning motivation”, “reading and exams”, “self-testing”, and “problem solving strategies”. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Software engineering education plays an important role in keeping students educated with software technologies, processes, and practices that are needed by industries. Nevertheless, the nature of software engineering learning activities in traditional classrooms is limited in scope and time, making it more difficult to achieve a proper balance between theory and practice and address industrial demands. This makes scant provision for assisting students in keeping their software engineering knowledge current. To support software engineering education, flipped learning is a suitable strategy. Prior studies have shown that students’ perceptions in flipped learning environments are better than those in traditional learning environments. Nevertheless, in flipped learning, students may not have sufficient ability to conduct learning out of class. Therefore, the flipped learning strategy should aim to meet the needs of students to ensure that they get the appropriate support or feedback during the learning process before the class. The aim of this study was to propose a flipped learning diagnosis approach to promote students’ learning out of class in the flipped classroom. To explore students’ learning performance in software engineering courses, three classes of students were invited to learn with three different learning approaches (traditional learning approach, flipped learning approach, and flipped learning diagnosis approach). The results showed that the students who learned with the flipped learning diagnosis approach outperformed those students who learned with the flipped learning approach or the traditional learning approach. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study presents findings from three different disciplines in STEMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medicine) and across different models of student-focused teaching. Specifically, we assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of flipped classroom approaches combined with team based learning (TBL), and TBL alone within STEMM, particularly in the disciplines of Physics, Engineering and Medicine across different year levels. TBL activities were incorporated into undergraduate Physics and Engineering cohorts, with students from a diverse range of majors and backgrounds and a graduate level Doctor of Medicine (MD) cohort. Quiz scores from the Physics cohort were significantly improved following TBL, exam scores from the engineering cohort were more evenly distributed than pre-TBL quiz scores and students in the medical cohort had higher quiz scores when working within teams rather than alone. Qualitative survey responses from both the physics and engineering cohorts indicated that students felt TBL was positive and increased their understanding of key concepts. Informal feedback from medical students following TBL classes was also very positive and students demonstrated obvious engagement. Comparisons for pre- versus post-TBL quiz scores for Physics, for pre-TBL quartile versus exam scores in Engineering and for Team versus Individual learning quiz scores in Medicine all provide evidence of effective student engagement and performance. The observation study suggests that TBL is a feasible and effective method of student-focused learning within STEMM. More rigorously designed studies are now required to further explore these findings. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, university education has faced a significant challenge that requires adaptation to virtual and online education. Here, a fruitful flipped methodology with increased popularity can support adaption to and improvement of the current pandemic situation. This research presents a comparison of two different instruction situations with an identical teaching methodology, face-to-face (F2F) and face-to-screen (F2S) flipped methodology, in terms of students' performance and affective domain in a science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) course. It was considered and designed as an examination of 132 pre-service teachers (PSTs), with 68 and 64 PSTs respectively for each group. The first group before the pandemic was applied by F2F flipped classroom and the second group after the pandemic was applied by F2S flipped classroom. The results after pertaining various data analyses of class activities and questionaries showed that performance had been improved for both groups toward the course. In addition, F2F had a significant difference in PSTs' emotion and perception toward the course and made classes more interactive. The mean score values of students' emotion and perception between two groups showed that the difference between these mean values were significant, suggesting a very large effect. Particularly, the effect size (ES) showed that positive emotions were more significant with different variables and the items Q7–Q9 of questionnaires indicated more significant different perceptions for both F2F and F2S after completing the course. Finally, the principal component analysis (PCA) test described that F2F answers were located mainly in the positive emotion, while F2S answers were grouped in the negative emotion, while no differences were observed for PSTs perceptions to the flipped methodology. Consequently, although F2F–F2S transition was an effective process, instructors and PSTs faced difficulties in the platform usage for online lectures reflecting emotions' results in F2S group. Thus, by solving the problems raised, it will allow PSTs to be more interactive in a virtual and online context for their future implementation by giving them active instruction methodology and educating future students to teach STEM contents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Traditionally, these skills were mainly developed in laboratory classes, but technology allows us to explore other and complementary ways of aiding students in this achievement. This paper presents a contribution to improve the way OpAmps are included in electronic engineering courses' curricula. A reconfigurable and expandable kit to teach electronic circuits based on the OpAmp uA741 was designed and implemented. This kit comprises a software application locally interfaced with a hardware platform capable of running in a PC. This platform includes a circuit with the OpAmp uA741 able to reconfigure according to a set of parameters defined by a software application. Its reconfiguration capability also enables the establishment of automatic connections for measuring and for applying signals to a reconfigured circuit, plus the ability to simulate the same or other OpAmp-based circuits. This paper provides an overview about the OpAmp uA741 and its relevance in engineering education. After presenting the kit and make some considerations for its improvement, at the end a brief discussion about its implementation in education according to specific educational strategies and methodologies are provided. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flipped classroom is an active-learning strategy in which student activities that are traditionally completed at home are exchanged, or “flipped”, with activities traditionally completed in class. In engineering, this approach usually means class time is used for student-led problem solving and interpreting results-a situation that promotes higher levels of cognitive work in the classroom under the tutelage of the instructor and peers. The flipped classroom model was recently instituted at State University of New York (SUNY) Maritime College in a junior-level engineering course with a student population of largely varying abilities and career goals, including students who seek U.S. Coast Guard licensure. The motivation for adopting the flipped classroom model was threefold: (1) The traditional classroom may be a disconnect for license students who often work in teams and spend many hours in active-learning environments like ship simulators and on a training ship. Thus, it is reasonable to suspect that the flipped classroom model may resonate well with license students who seem to thrive in these hands-on environments. (2) Prior research demonstrates the flipped classroom model benefits a wide variety of students with wide-ranging abilities, which aligns well with the course's student body. (3) Prior to flipping, the course was showing a concerning trending decline in student performance and a wide gap between student and instructor expectations, motivating the instructor to consider alternative teaching strategies. The objective of this paper is to estimate the effect classroom flipping has on engineering students, particularly license students, and determine the statistical significance of the observed effect. This objective is met by first retrieving the final student grades in the selected course in a timeframe that includes a pre- and post-flipping period (2016-2019), as well as the final student grades in a similar control course that was not flipped during the same time period. The data also include whether or not each student was a license student, which allows for the construction of three datasets: one of only license students, one of only non-license students (“interns”), and one of all students. Then the well-established difference-in-differences (DiD) technique is employed to each of the datasets in order to measure the effect flipping the selected course has on final course grades. Lastly, random inference is applied to calculate p-values and determine the statistical significance of the observed effect. It is found that license students see an average increase of +0.583 grade point average (on a 4-point scale), at a confidence level of 99%, which is a greater effect than what intern students see, which is a +0.474 increase on average, at a confidence level of 95%. Also included are comments and results of a poll that was completed by students in the flipped classroom meant to gauge their satisfaction in the course and what they believe the effect the flipped classroom had on them in meeting the course learning objectives. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Understanding possible influential factors and their effect on a student's overall performance is imperative for educators to be able to effectively facilitate the comprehension of computer science concepts. With an increase in the amount of research supporting active learning over a traditional learning experience, universities are shifting their course offerings to a flipped classroom environment. This paper focuses on exploring the effect of different students' engagement patterns on their overall course performance in an introductory programming (CS1) course for engineering students in a flipped classroom environment. The course expects students to view prerecorded lecture videos and complete a quiz prior to the scheduled class time, with the in-person instructional period reserved for practicing programming activities. After the class, students are expected to submit a homework assignment based on the concepts learned that week. We are particularly interested in understanding when students submit the quizzes and homework assignments, and if the submission time has any effect on their performance in the course. This paper presents the analysis of 145 students' weekly quiz and homework submission times to understand at which point a student engages with the content and how it affects their performance. Different observed categories are presented to help understand the behavioral aspects of student engagement. Further, analysis is also done considering factors like prior programming experience. We found that students who submitted the quizzes and homeworks 24 hours prior to the submission deadline had significantly higher exam scores as compared to students who submitted during the last 24 hours. Additionally, we also found that this difference was only significant for students who did not have prior programming experience. This indicates that early submission of assignments can help students who do not have prior programming experience in improving their overall course performance. By understanding the major student interaction patterns, we believe that instructors and educators can better design learning experiences for students in CS1 courses. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the COVID-19 era, hybrid classes have become the norm. Even though online classes have been there for a while, a proper design of the engineering education courses to motivate the students to learn the material, keeping students' attention span and excitement level intact has been a challenge for the instructors. To overcome this challenge and design a generic course structure that can be used for engineering as well as science courses, this research has produced the design of the course structure in the most convenient form. The present study of the hybrid course design structure will help in increasing the student attention span as well as help in motivating the students and keeping their excitement about the course content at high levels throughout the semester. To achieve this feat for a variety of engineering courses, the course structure was designed and implemented at Texas A&M University, and implemented and evaluated at Saint Ambrose University in form of student surveys. At Texas A&M University, courses of Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics and Strength of Materials were used to design the hybrid course structure. The course structure uses class lecture broken down into lecture, group problem-solving activity including breakout rooms on Zoom, a relevant video for a “hook” to show the concept with practical application and a one-minute paper in the end to answer any questions. At Saint Ambrose University, the Electronics course is designed as a flipped classroom hybrid course broken into modules. Students have pre- and post-class material to engage in where they earn engagement or participation credits. The setup is very flexible, responsive to students, and easily switches to an online format if required. Before class, students begin engaging with the material by posting notes from reading, watching video lectures covering class content normally provided during class time, and reading quizzes. During class, students actively engage with the material through various activities such as worksheets and practice problems. After class, students can assess themselves with practice problems. Electronics also incorporates hybrid labs that aid students' understanding of the course material. All this prepares students for instructor assessment through quizzes, exams, or other activities like a topic presentation. Both of these course structure designs are compatible with Face-To-Face instruction as well. These case studies will give the required insight into the teaching effectiveness of the designed structure used during the semester. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Covid - 19 has radically changed how group activities are carried out across the world especially in countries with higher incidence of the disease, like the US. An activity of concern to the educators is face-to-face teaching in classroom, in-lab work, in-person office hours, in-class exams and group-based project activities. The Covid-19 epidemic required most educators to move all these activities online. Given that the flipped and online classes are a common practice in this era of internet technology, there was no dearth of resources. The resources to deliver lectures included blackboard, zoom, or skype. For labs, some of the options were no labs, or remote lab access with VPN after porting labs from hardware to software or providing hardware kits to students for remote lab work. Office hours could be offered either via skype, blackboard or zoom. Exams could be given either over zoom, skype, prairie learn, gradescope, blackboard or ProctorU. Exam format could be open book, take home, multiple choice or essay type questions. Exam submission could be scanning in either hand-written or typed document. Disruption due to COVID-19 pandemic happened in the middle of the Spring 2020 semester. For the courses that were being offered in traditional face-to-face mode, the challenge was to select the best possible method of course delivery with least effort, inconvenience and time spent on training course staff, and students. This paper reviews the online teaching methods that were available at our university. It provides justification for using the chosen online platforms over others for delivering the course-Introduction to VLSI Design. Online teaching was found to be more effective over face-to-face based on comparison of student grades and course evaluations. The paper identifies the problems encountered during online teaching and the steps taken to mitigate them. Further, we highlight how the lessons learnt during the Spring 2020 semester were used to improve teaching methodology during the Fall 2020 semester. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Despite a consensus that engineering students need exposure to ethical decision-making, the degree to which ethics are incorporated into undergraduate curricula remains varied. At Duke University, the engineering departments use a patchwork approach to ethics education, although all students are exposed to ethics in the capstone design course. A new, required first-year design course (EGR 101) for all incoming engineering students presented an opportunity to strengthen students' ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities and to make informed judgments. EGR 101 is a project-based design course in which student teams are matched with clients in the community to solve an identified problem. Through the work of creating the solutions to these problems, the teams learn about and apply the engineering design process. The design process consists of seven steps: clarifying the team assignment, understanding the problem, defining design criteria, brainstorming solutions, evaluating solutions, prototyping, and testing. Steps in the design process are taught using a flipped classroom method, in which students watch videos detailing the process prior to class. Then, in class, students complete short in-class activities before applying that knowledge to their team's design challenge. To incorporate engineering ethics into EGR 101, a joint faculty and student team with expertise in engineering and ethics developed the described materials. After establishing learning outcomes, the team targeted different steps of the engineering design process to situate ethical discussions. The team utilized the very same design process to develop course modules that would achieve these learning outcomes. Ultimately, the team created four engineering ethics modules that include videos and short in-class activities. Implemented in Fall 2020, the modules correspond with and are embedded within the four steps of the engineering design process: 1. Systems Mapping. Students learn to identify the people, societal issues, and materials that are integral to the assigned team project's problem space. Through drawing a systems map, students analyze how their project and its intended goal connect to the world around them. 2. Pairwise Comparison Chart Activity. Students assume the role of various stakeholders (those invested in the project in some way) to complete a pairwise comparison chart, thus simulating how different stakeholders make trade-offs when determining important design criteria. 3. Testing Game Show. As students test their own products, the entire class is brought together to compete in an interactive, game-show style activity about the ethics of product testing. Then, students design testing plans for their project that are both effective and consider related ethical questions. 4. Game of Life Cycle. Students engage in a Life Cycle carnival game in which teams rotate through five stations of activities. These stations have been designed to teach and to encourage thoughtful discussions about the ethical and environmental implications of the materials that students used in their design solution. Achievement of these goals was measured using an IRB-approved pre/post study, which recognized that each student would enter the course at a different point of ethical awareness. The assessment questionnaire was based on a combination of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ) [1] and a novel instrument focused on the intersection of technology and ethics developed by faculty at Duke University. With data collected in Fall 2020, we analyzed student survey data and found few significant results. In summary, the suite of developed modules that are embedded into the first-year engineering design course should lead to the development of an ethical mindset at the outset of students' engineering education. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the implementation of flipped classrooms in engineering education has experienced tremendous growth. This approach typically features asynchronous lecture content delivery outside of the classroom, which frees up in-class time to be spent on more active learning methods with instructor interaction, such as problem-solving sessions. The flipped classroom model was implemented into a sophomore-level Computer Applications course at The Citadel a number of years ago, with positive results. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, classes at The Citadel have adopted the HyFlex teaching model, in which a course is simultaneously taught in-person in the classroom and via synchronous online delivery. While this method reduces classroom capacity to enable social distancing, it has also impacted the ability of the instructor to provide one-on-one instruction to students as they complete the in-class exercises. The use of classroom technology, including various cameras, annotation devices, and supporting software, has not only solved some of the challenges introduced in the HyFlex model, but has also provided improvements upon the standard flipped class. The present paper will discuss the classroom technology and methods used to supplement traditional in-class assistance to provide one-on-one interaction to students both in the classroom and those attending synchronously online, with a discussion of lessons learned and best practices. Direct and indirect course assessment and student perceptions of learning will be compared between the traditional flipped classroom and a flipped class using the HyFlex model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study investigates student perceptions of a flipped classroom computer-aided design (CAD) course. While flipped classroom models are gaining popularity in higher education, student's attitudes towards these courses are often mixed. Over three years, a first-year engineering CAD course was “flipped” by the instructor recording short video demos of SOLIDWORKS techniques for students to watch outside of class in addition to step-by-step text instructions. While in class, the instructor gave a brief overview of new techniques, and then the rest of class time was used to complete homework assignments and group projects. At the end of the course, student perceptions of the course were assessed by an anonymous survey. More than 75% of the students responded that they preferred this CAD course be taught in the flipped classroom format over a traditional lecture format (without video demos); however, when asked about other courses, only 33% of students preferred their other courses to be taught in a flipped classroom format. Student comments to explain their preferences show that engineering graphics design and software-based courses may be best suited to the flipped classroom model over other course topics. To improve student attitudes towards flipped classroom courses, the videos should be recorded by the instructor and available for replay as many times as needed. The instructor should also allow some class time to work on homework or traditionally “outside of class” assignments to make up for the out of class time required by students to watch the videos. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper is a continuation with preliminary results of an approach to performing a quantitative, objective, and real-time measurement of student engagement in the STEM classroom. This will be realized by an Engagement Measurement System (EMS) consisting of a Biometric Sensor Network (BSN) and an instructor dashboard for real-time display of student engagement. The BSN is multi-dimensional in that it incorporates facial expressions, eye gaze, and hand/head/body movement captured by camera, in addition to pulse captured by a wristband device, and other data. From these data, a machine-learning model is trained to classify behavioral and emotional components of student engagement. This training is facilitated and supervised by human expert observers within each classroom. Classification of behavioral and emotional engagement in turn predicts students' cognitive engagement, which is validated against academic performance in coursework. The ability to measure student engagement can be used by the instructor to tailor the presentation of material in class, identify course material that engages and disengages with students, and identify students who are engaged or disengaged and at risk of failure. Further, this approach allows quantitative comparison of teaching methods, such as lecture, flipped classrooms, classroom response systems, etc. such that an objective metric can be used for teaching evaluation with immediate closed-loop feedback to the instructor. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has brought multiple social, economic, and technological divides to the forefront as key societal issues that were previously silent to the engineering and STEM community. These issues must be addressed through social innovations that can be easily implemented at the point of need. Social innovations are defined as new solutions (products, services, models, markets, processes, etc.) that simultaneously meet a social need (more effectively than existing solutions) and lead to new or improved capabilities and relationships and better use of assets and resources [1]. The design and development of socially conscious and frugal engineering solutions are a critical part of many of these techno-economic social innovations [2]. This is calling for new approaches to implement social innovation and entrepreneurship education to the engineering students, in addition to the traditional STEM curriculum. Additionally, in the primarily 'remote' learning mode during the COVID-19 pandemic, different pedagogies are crucial for effective and engaged student learning. This paper presents the methodology, highlights, and execution of the “Social Innovations: Engineering, Globalization, and Leadership” class that was conducted 'virtually' through the 8-week summer session of 2020. The motivation behind the class was to introduce, educate and encourage students to learn, adopt and implement attributes of social innovation philosophies and servant leadership via case studies and discussion during the class meeting times. Weekly modules were developed to include one social innovation case study (including presentation rubric) per week and leadership lessons. The class proceeded in the flipped classroom approach, where each student presented their perspective and analysis of the assigned social innovation case study, followed by interactive discussion within the group. Throughout the class, students advanced their understanding of the attributes of social innovation and leadership and its context to globalization and social equity. Concurrently, students were divided among two groups for the class project to practice the development of frugal engineering solutions for the COVID-19 pandemic. The projects focused on developing a multi-functional mask (physical) and a fact check plugin (digital), to prevent the spread of virus and misinformation, respectively. The project was executed in parallel with the class and culminated in an 'open house' presentation attended by multiple invited faculty and industry professionals. Throughout the duration of the class, each student developed their own model and attributes for delivering impactful social innovation along with a leadership mind map as a part of the final report. Students were graded based on their presentations, in-class interactive participation, and the final project report. At the end of the semester, based on the feedback from the students as well as the open house attendees, this virtual class, helped students to build a framework for social innovation, entrepreneurship, and leadership for successful implementation within the frugal engineering model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Newly imposed educational delivery modalities such as mixed-mode or fully remote instruction due to the Covid-19 pandemic have resulted in creative, innovative instructional approaches to undergraduate engineering education. However, given the unique circumstances caused by the pandemic and the constraints it placed on students, some instructional techniques have been more successful than others. It is crucial for future efforts in remote and hybrid teaching environments to use this opportunity to document the realized benefits, unforeseen negative consequences, and student perceptions of various teaching strategies. This paper traces lessons learned through mixed-mode and remote instruction of structural engineering courses for three different courses and student populations: (1) introduction to steel design and (2) indeterminate analysis for structural engineering concentrators, and (3) steel and concrete design for engineering concentrators in other sub-disciplines. Across these courses, initial teaching strategies included a mixture of flipped classroom, traditional lectures, and interactive group problem solving. Collectively, the instructors determined through ongoing formal and informal student surveys, as well as additional unstructured feedback, that proposed teaching strategies required adjustments as the semester progressed. Some technological limitations were discovered after rigorous testing with live students, while successful technological strategies included digital problem sessions with document cameras, and chat-based questions with discussions. Furthermore, depending on course size and student population, students tended to engage more readily compared to verbal questions directed to the instructor during remote live classes. This engagement varied among written e-mails and chats, discussion boards, and Teaching Assistant (TA) office hours. To build on initial findings from individual course feedback, all three classes were evaluated using a common mid-term and end-of-term survey soliciting student reactions to content delivery, technology aides, and interactions with instructors/TAs. Overall, lessons learned through mixed-mode and remote instruction in structural engineering can inform future educators in this field, reducing time spent surveying available technologies and pointing towards strategies shown to be effective in this context. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The increasing use of information and communication technologies (ICT) has caused innumerable changes in today's society. While ICTs are also present in the classroom, the approach to content during class time retains its traditional structure. Innovative proposals aiming to change traditional methodology could be of great benefit for students, seeking to turn the student into the centre of their own learning. Among these innovative proposals, the Flipped Classroom has gained more relevance owing its success to the use of video, audio and text files that are sent out before the synchronous class actually meets so that students have prior access to contents, downloaded into their smartphones and accessed whenever and wherever they wish. This paper aims to investigate the benefits of using an innovation “Flipped Classroom + Podcast” in a Geophysics course for Geology students at a private Chilean university. A descriptive research approach is used to determine if the use of podcasts has a positive impact on students' attitudes and if they are perceived as a useful tool in knowledge building. The data was obtained at the end of a six-month period through validated instruments such as Student Satisfaction with Educational Podcasts Questionnaire (SSEPQ) and “Student Response to Instructional Practices” (StRIP). Results and implications of this pilot study are discussed at the end of this paper and point towards students attaining greater motivation and engagement. Such findings have triggered further longitudinal studies to be undertaken for 2021, whose results would be available in the coming months. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Collegiate education requires a multi-faceted instructional approach both within and outside the classroom to effectively build student comprehension and competency. There are well-documented in-class activities that increase student engagement and learning, such as in-person and computer-based think-pair-share activities [1],[2] and polling [3]. There are also complementary out-of-class activities that augment in-class learning by fortifying key concepts. Flipped course formats within traditional synchronous [4]-[6] and asynchronous instruction [7], and more recently the use of Makerspaces [8]-[10] are examples of these activities. An often-overlooked area of out-of-class instruction is the ability to effectively utilize a textbook throughout the various stages of learning. To this end, an interactive textbook was developed in the Top Hat software platform and implemented in a sophomore-level Statics and Mechanics of Materials course. Surveys were conducted to better understand student perceptions of, and interaction and engagement with, an online textbook. The text was built in a concept-example-question format, based on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), where concepts were introduced conceptually, graphically and mathematically. This introduction was followed by illustrative examples. Embedded questions tested the understanding of, and competency with, the online textbook material. Thus, within the text alone, students had multiple exposures to the content, reinforcing the conversion of short-term memory to long-term memory recall [11]. Additionally, the text was co-authored by a student who had recently taken the course and who was able to provide insight into which concepts and aspects of the course their peers struggled with. One of the novel aspects of this text are embedded questions, which bridged in-class and out-of-class instruction. Students were assigned portions of the text as reading assignments, and were required to answer embedded questions. Embedded questions are adaptable by the instructor as to provide help if a student answers incorrectly, to allow multiple answer attempts, to provide instantaneous feedback in the form of showing the correct solution after the last attempt, and to count as participation and/or correctness points. Top Hat's platform tracks student performance and notifies the instructor of questions with low averages such that remedial measures can be introduced at different points in the learning process, such as during class. The implementation of the concept-example-question format, coupled with the uniqueness of Top Hat's embedded question feedback mechanisms, provides a high level of interactivity and engagement not available within conventional texts. To ascertain the effectiveness of an interactive text on student learning, engagement and satisfaction, a mixed-methods study was performed involving three sections of the course. A survey composed of both open- and closed-ended questions was administered to each section at the end of the semester, and was used to gauge student interest, engagement, and perceptions of the textbook. Preliminary results indicate a high level of student satisfaction and favorable attitudes toward the extent and frequency of interactivity. Students have indicated they feel confident and competent with the course material by having recurrent interaction and instant feedback regarding their comprehension and understanding. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As a student-centered learning model, flipped classroom has been increasingly preferred among educators since it has changed the traditional teacher-centered learning model. This study conducted experiments and observations on the flipped classroom for digital logic courses for first-year students in the electrical engineering department of a junior college in Taiwan. Before each class, these students were required to watch the prescribed lecture video units. In class, students discussed with group members after thinking and completed the teacher’s requirements by collaboration. In addition to conducting the activities of thinking, discussion, collaboration and observation, these students also got to exercise their expression skills through interactive activities during class time. Analyzing the learning effectiveness with the Panel Data Method (PDM), this study, by comparing and statistically analyzing the data collected during the four years between 2016 and 2019, found that students reaped better learning performance with the flipped classroom model, as shown by a rise in both their average grade and the pass rate. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines a practical intervention aiming to collect the effects of introducing flexible learning in engineering higher education. The work discusses the implementation of the flipped classroom method and the threshold concepts in the Turbomachinery section of Fluid Engineering course in the third year of Mechanical Engineering (Bachelor's degree) at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. Fluid Engineering is traditionally one of the hardest courses involving a complex interaction between understanding concepts and using those concepts in the solution of cases, which also require the development of a set of skills. This case study is centred on two student cohorts, and the research spans over two consecutive Fall semesters. The study is based on sound pedagogy of educational technologies, in practice, frequent student-to-instructor interaction, academic results, and statistical and survey analyses. A principal conclusion is that overall class performance is much higher than that of the previous courses. The results indicate that learners gained understanding from semester to semester and no statistical significance was observed between group and exam format. Students were satisfied with the level of suitability and the degree of compliance of the new implementation and found it constructive in their learning process, an important educational benefit. This positive experience, in terms of benefit-cost and outcomes, encourages the intervention without sacrificing any curriculum syllabus, but taking advantage and bringing the benefits of interactivity distance learning technologies and traditional face-to-face lectures. This scholarly research aims to contribute to this area, by abandoning traditional lecturing in favour of active learning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a massive disruption in the way traditional higher education institutions deliver their courses. Unlike transitions from face-to-face teaching to blended, online or flipped classroom in the past, changes in emergency remote teaching –a temporary shift of instructional delivery to an alternate remote delivery mode due to crisis circumstances– happen suddenly and in an unplanned way. This study analyzes the move to emergency remote teaching at the School of Telecommunication Engineering (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid), and the impact of organizational aspects related to unplanned change, instruction-related variables –class size, synchronous/asynchronous delivery– and use of digital supporting technologies, on students' academic performance. Using quantitative data of academic records across all (N = 43) courses of a bachelor's degree programme in Telecommunication Engineering and qualitative data from a questionnaire delivered to all (N = 43) course coordinators, the research also compares the academic results of students during the COVID-19 pandemic with those of previous years. The results of this case study show an increase in students' academic performance in emergency remote teaching, and support the idea that organizational factors may contribute to successful implementation of emergency remote teaching; the analysis does not find differences across courses with different class sizes or delivery modes. The study further explores possible explanations for the results of the analysis, considering organizational, individual and instruction-related aspects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The lesson calendar, study guide, modules, worksheets, and problem sets were organized in tabs and instructions were clearly stated for ease of use. Using Greeno's model of scientific problem-solving and reasoning, the students' solutions were analysed using maps of the problem-solving approaches they utilized. The students had difficulty comprehending problems and identifying which concepts are related to them. In terms of Greeno's model, this implies that the students were not able to successfully translate concepts between domains. There were no traces of use of other domains apart from the abstract and symbolic domains, when an improved understanding must include translations between all four domains - namely, the concrete domain, which involves physical objects or events; the model domain, which refers to representations of objects or events; the abstract domain, which involves concepts or principles; and the symbolic domain, which is the mathematical representation of concepts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {To avoid spread of novel corona virus, in the second week of March, state government advised to close schools & colleges till further announcement. There was no certainty about reopening. This was a decisive time for the education sector to switch from physical classroom teaching to online classroom teaching. The primary objective of our institute was continuous learning and facilitates teaching-learning process through online teaching. It is an observation that few courses are found to be difficult for students even in physical classrooms and teacher need to employ different active learning strategies to make class active & engaged. Thus same issue was found in online teaching. Therefore we employed micro learning strategy for the course Theory of computation at S.Y. B.Tech.(Computer Science & Engineering). "Micro learning is a holistic approach for skill based learning and education which deals with relatively small learning units.[1]"In this approach, micro level activities were designed, each activity containing a series of short videos, quiz & assignments. Thus we have designed 25 micro level activities for 2 units covering 25% curriculum. Flipped classroom is used as instructional strategy while implementing micro learning. These activities helped to engage students and keep active even in online environment. Tests conducted at the end of topic and perception survey showed that students enjoyed while learning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The process of online and offline mixed teaching reform of MATLAB simulation technology course is summarized in this paper, based on "MOOC+SPOC+flipped classroom". MOOC is taken as basic learning platform, and SPOC is taken asynchronously as supplementary teaching management for students of different majors and different levels. Teachers can explain important knowledge points in offline class times and implement discussion-based and exploratory teaching mode. This teaching mode is student-centered, which helps to improve their ability of solving practical engineering problems. Students learn simulation course through MOOC and SPOC online and then carry on flipped classroom. Through practice, this mixed teaching mode has played a positive role in teaching process, effectively stimulating students' learning interest, enhancing students' ability of self-learning, presentation and teamwork, and improved the teaching quality. However, further practices and improvements are still needed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Investigating the current college computer-common class teaching in South China University of Technology (SCUT), it's indicated that although the online and offline blended teaching was practiced, there's still a lack of classroom interaction and hierarchical teaching. So high-quality teaching needs a reform of teaching mode urgently. In order to improve the teaching quality of computer-common class, an online and offline blended teaching mode with the integration of three supports, three concepts and three stages is proposed, analyzing the characteristics of learners and constructing online courses. The three concepts are "student-centered", "teaching practice as the key point"and "focusing on students' learning process "respectively. With the supports of teaching, management and evaluation, a three-stage teaching process is designed, which consists of pre-class preparation, the teaching activities based on flipped classroom and the evaluation. This study took the course: "Multimedia Technology and Application (MTA)", as an example to carry out this blended teaching mode in SCUT from 2017 to 2019. The results implied that this model had promoted students' participation and interest in learning, improved the achievement of course objectives and teaching quality, and boost students' computational thinking ability and information literacy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flipped classroom (FC) pedagogical frameworks have recently gained considerable popularity, especially at secondary school levels. However, there are rich opportunities to explore FC at tertiary levels, but progress on the area requires instructors’ attention to well-designed tasks for students’ collaborative learning. Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) provides a foundation for the development of such tasks. This article advances research on the role of task design in a FC context by considering how RME heuristics may be developed to include the out-of-class phase, where students prepare for in-class work with videos. This adaption, named flipped RME classroom design, is explored through two realizations of such a design with a group of computer engineering students during their first year of studying compulsory mathematics. Thematic analysis of the classroom observations shows that students’ modelling activity in-class is supported by the design of an out-of-class component in combination with teacher guidance of students’ modelling activity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Therefore, the author puts forward a new blended teaching model suitable for the development of new technology. This model runs through the development process of actual projects and emphasizes student-centered learning. The implementation of the course content is completed through a blended learning model combining students' online self-study and offline self-design. The characteristic of this model is to make full use of the resources of the network course platform to enable students to complete relatively simple project links independently, such as self-study of basic knowledge. In this way, the class hours saved can deepen the depth of offline practical teaching. This model has been implemented in four classes of two sessions in our school. The practice has proved that this teaching model effectively improves students' learning autonomy and ability of engineering practice. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

They enrolled in the road design course from Civil Engineering at the Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja (Ecuador). The course was face-to-face but turn to remote mode due to CoViD-19. To reach the goal, six learning moments were planned for each topic: 1) watch the prerecorded lecture on YouTube ®, 2) based on the video, create a comic image, 3) grade the images of 2 of their classmates, 4) attend a synchronous virtual class to participate in a problem-solving session, 5) attend a synchronous virtual class to develop a road project (teamwork) and 6) prepare an infographic or presentation of the project's progress (also in teamwork). Data was collected through a voluntary survey at the end of the course. The failure rate and the grades obtained by the groups were also calculated. As a result, the students considered the course methodology was positive, rating it from 1 to 10 as 8.91 (A) and 9.17 (B). They develop a self-learning skill, on the same scale, 7.38 (A) and 7.70 (B). The study showed that with this combination of techniques, it is possible to reduce the failure rate, increase grades, and improve the learning experience. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study examined the application of PI to an Introductory Computer Science course for year-one students taught in English that is not their native language. We aimed to identify the effectiveness of PI to improve students' content learning and English skills. Throughout the analysis of a survey of students' perceptions, we found evidence of the success of PI in terms of engagement and learning of the students, as occurred in previous studies. We found also encouraging results regarding the opportunities provided by PI to improve students non-native language skills. However, we found alarming results regarding the lack of pre-class reading preparation. Instructors should handle this issue since it is a crucial component when implementing the PI methodology for content learning and knowledge acquisition. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This Innovative Practice Full Paper notes that recent research has indicated that large numbers of college and university students make limited use of their class textbooks. This is particularly true in terms of assigned readings - whether they are required for the course or not. Students are knowingly depriving themselves of an important means of learning. While the falling use of textbooks among students is concerning, it should be especially so because of the ongoing pandemic. The pandemic has forced much of the secondary educational experience online, limiting forms of in-person lectures and group activities, and severely restricting or rendering impossible hands-on assignments such as labs and projects. It is clear that the current environment students find themselves in is not optimized for learning. In an attempt to increase student understanding of course material, an online, interactive textbook was created using the software platform Top Hat The book is in its first edition, and is for use with the university's engineering course Statics and Mechanics of Materials. It was written and developed by a professor with years of teaching experience and course development, and by a student who had previously taken the course and has worked as a certified tutor for the university. The textbook employs pedagogies designed to increase student understanding of material, such as active learning, and is used in conjunction with a flipped classroom format. To facilitate this approach, the book has readings that are to be completed before lecture in preparation for various class activities, including group assignments and discussions and think-pair-share. Questions are embedded within the assigned readings for the students to check their understanding of the material. These questions provide instant feedback to the students, either informing them their answer was correct, or alerting them it was incorrect and giving hints to help solve the problem. As the textbook makes use of educational strategies known to improve student learning, it is desired to know if the book had a positive impact on their understanding of the course material. One method of evaluating the online text is to compare students' text use with their level of achievement in the course. Two factors related directly to text use were investigated: the number of questions in the textbook students answered correctly (Correctness) and the number of questions in the textbook answered in general (Participation). The students were categorized into three levels (low, medium, and high) based on their respective score for each variable and two, one-way between-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to determine if there existed a significant difference between student textbook usage (participation and correctness) and overall course grades. Post hoc testing was then performed to determine differences between the three groups. Both F-tests were significant, with significant differences found between the different groups for both correctness and participation. The largest difference occurred between the top and bottom thirds of the class with respect to question correctness, with the difference in mean final course grades being a full letter grade. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Engineering instructors often rely on lectures as their primary mode of instruction even in project courses. In the lecture mode of instruction student engagement with the course material is often low or non-existent. Many engineering educators regard experiential learning as the best way to train the next generation of software engineers. For the past five years, one of the authors has taught a junior level software engineering course using active learning methods in a flipped classroom setting. During this past year, the COVID-19 lockdown prevented in-person delivery of this course. The challenge facing engineering faculty everywhere is figuring out how to include active learning experiences in online course delivery. This paper describes the authors' experiences introducing active learning methodologies into a junior level online software engineering course. The project team carefully considered the active learning course materials used in the in-person delivery of this course and adapted them to accommodate the idiosyncrasies of an online course delivery environment. Most importantly, a comparable online course delivery alternative needed to include zoom video class sessions containing live active learning exercises. The investigators compared the levels of student engagement between previous in-person offerings of the course with the online adaptation of the same course. Student engagement data was collected from each style of course delivery. In some cases, this data was supplemented by observational data and with Canvas course analytics. We found that students in both course settings were least engaged when listening to short lectures (either live or video recordings) and felt most engaged when involved in small group activities (either in person or in Zoom sessions with breakout rooms). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this Research Full paper, we present the results of a replication study in a semester-long, sophomore-level software engineering course utilizing Peer Instruction (PI). PI is an active learning pedagogy with roots in STEM Education. In this study, we examine the relationship between student response data from in-class PI correctness and students' performance on quizzes and exams. We worked with a fully remote, synchronous course offered over Zoom. The study we replicated was with an honors cohort of students with a diversity of undergraduate majors, while we focused on a non-honors course containing computing-related majors. Our intervention design included a flipped-classroom approach for each class session with required readings, reading quizzes, followed by PI in class using online breakout rooms for peer discussion. Our course modules were heavily based on industry practices and knowledge from the workforce, across several varied modules that encompass the complete software development lifecycle, and were as follows: Software Process Models (SPM), Software Architecture (SA), Databases (DB), User Interface/user Experience (UI/UX), Software Testing (ST), and Continuous Integration (CI). Our data points for analysis with fine-grained PI student response data were two-fold: scores from weekly online quizzes, and a summative final exam, administered online through a course management system (CMS), at different points during the semester after the PI sessions. The online quizzes and the online exam were timed, closed book/notes, and conducted during class periods. We analyzed and classified individual student responses before and after each question in each module and attempted to create response patterns for each module. We correlated these response patterns with exam and quiz scores using ANOVA techniques, on a variety of questions including Parson's problems. We report overall correctness on each type of vote, track student response patterns from in-class to quizzes and the exam, and quantify absolute percentages of students that demonstrate longer-term learning from the PI process. Our results show that 58% of students exhibited cognitive gains across all modules during PI sessions. Students who learn in class from PI perform well on the quizzes and the final exam, indicating persistence of the knowledge gained during PI several weeks after the actual sessions. We also found that those who fail to learn from the PI process in the class perform worse on quizzes and the final exam. Our results were consistent across all modules. More significantly, we found PI to be an effective way to teach our software engineering course based on student learning before and after PI, in a completely virtual environment, a result unique to our study. Based on our results, we discuss the implications for software engineering education, both in-person and virtual. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Method: A Design Thinking mindset questionnaire was given to 197 participants before and after this model was applied. A t-test was used to analyze the data. Findings: the DTIC model fostered students' mindsets such as empathy, holistic view, problem reframing, and teamwork. Students showed very positive feedback and reviews on the model. Implications to Research and Practice: DITC can assist students in grasping Design Thinking concepts, allowing them to understand real-world problems more effectively. This model can be used to support teamwork and problem-solving skills for online learning environments, especially during the Covid19 pandemic. We also included some suggestions for incorporating Design Thinking into the classroom so that this model can be applied more widely. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

For the method to develop successfully, the work of the teacher is fundamental. The teacher has to guide the students in the classroom and establish a series of criteria to help them according to the needs he/she perceives in each one of them. The main objective of this work is the creation of multimedia content, summarising the procedure, the material, the computer tools, the modeling and design, the writing of explanatory scripts, and the editing and editing of videos, for a further evaluation phase, which will serve to validate the generated models and the proposed pedagogical methodology. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, many institutions have pointed out that software developments are important to nations, societies, and individuals. However, to develop quality software, students should not only possess programming skills, but also have to apply the knowledge and skills of software engineering. This entails the importance of software engineering education. Currently, most software engineering courses were conducted using the traditional teaching strategy. Most students can only recite and understand the pertinent knowledge with concerning software engineering after learning. As mentioned above, this study adopts a learner-centered pedagogy, named flipped classroom, to improve software engineering education. Moreover, in order to promote students’ learning performance before the class in flipped classrooms, this study applies an e-book system, named BookRoll. By using the e-book system, students can learn at anytime and anywhere before the class. Simultaneously, their reading behaviors may be recorded by the system. Teachers can facilitate the student discussions and interactions with peers in the class by capturing and analyzing student reading status and further enhancing their learning performance. To explore students’ learning performance in software engineering courses, students from two classes were invited to learn with different learning approaches (flipped learning approach and flipped learning with e-book system approach). The experimental results showed that the students who learned with the proposed approach outperformed those students who learned with traditional flipped learning approach. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Information technology has become an important carrier for the implementation of flipped classrooms, giving full play to the role of modern education technology and transforming the traditional classroom teaching form into an important form in today's education reform. This article mainly studies the simulation of the flipped classroom model of listening and speaking teaching for English majors based on artificial intelligence. A total of 31 English majors were selected for the experiment, including 7 boys and 24 girls. After obtaining the consent of school leaders and teachers, 16 weeks of experimental teaching were carried out in the class. The experimental subjects had not been exposed to the flipped classroom teaching mode before the start of the experiment, and they were willing to participate in this experiment. After the phased flipped classroom teaching mode was carried out in the experimental class, the teaching objects in the experimental class were selected in the form of interview questionnaires to understand students' attitudes and acceptance of the flipped classroom teaching mode in English listening and speaking classes. Adjust and improve the poststage flipped classroom teaching model to provide reference. During the experiment, the control class adopted the multimedia courseware-assisted oral teaching method and, in the experimental class, flipped the classroom oral teaching mode. Teachers integrate resources when preparing lessons to design flip-flop classroom oral English teaching, and teachers guide students to use the internet to search for resources and preview independently. The average value of the English self-management learning ability of the students of this major was 27.48 points before the experiment started. After passing the experiment, the score increased to 38.90 points, and the average value increased significantly (t = -20.189, P<0.01). A comparatively complete comparison of English listening and speaking teaching results was carried out. Before the implementation of the flipped classroom, the students' average professional English score was 76.23 points, and the average score after the launch was 84.39 points. The overall average score increased by 8.16 points. With regard to students' English learning scores, there has been some improvement. The results show that, through the implementation of flipped classrooms, students have exercised their ability to self-manage their learning and strengthened their ability to make learning plans, implement them, and reflect on the effectiveness of learning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the application of formative assessment methods in a flipped freshman engineering circuits course. This student-centered approach provided value for the instructor seeking to improve the learning environment and content in real-time, and for the students who actively participated in the process of course improvement. Three types of assessment were used in this course: online formative course feedback every three weeks; weekly ‘muddiest point’ content feedback; and midterm exam scores. Data were assessed using a mixed-methods approach. The formative feedback from this course provided information on how students perceived the flipped classroom and how those perceptions changed across the semester. This approach provided a low-effort strategy for incorporating the student voice for teaching and learning improvement. Although the intended assessment outcome was real-time improvement of the course, an unintended outcome of incorporating student voices and reflection during the course process was realized. Student acceptance of the flipped class increased as the semester progressed, and they placed high value on in-class active learning, the ability to re-visit the online lectures, and having a professor who valued their feedback and suggestions for course improvement. The majority of students also faced time management challenges that extended beyond this specific class © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The emergence of open online courses and flipped classrooms has brought new opportunities to unbundle the traditional university. This study aimed to investigate a thermal physics classroom integrated with an open online learning mode to afford various learning strategies for students in Taiwan. Moreover, we examined students’ preferred learning modes by adopting a quasi-experimental design with questionnaires, pre-test and post-test scores, self-reported journals and interviews. A total of 89 students participated in the study. The instructor allowed all students enrolled in the class to choose their own preferred learning modes. All students had full access to all course materials in both open online course and traditional face-to-face learning contexts throughout the whole semester. We examined the learners’ academic performance in each learning mode and surveyed their perceptions of the course. The findings of this study indicate that information technology can transform teaching and learning in a thermal physics classroom and challenge the instructor to tailor the course to meet students’ diverse needs. Significantly, students adopted five learning modes, consisting of face-to-face, web facilitated, alternative blended, online learning and flipped learning. This study provides a valuable reference on how traditional on-campus higher education institutions could be unbundled to create student-centred learning approaches. Implications for practice or policy: • Educators could design a flexible delivery model, allowing students to choose five learning modes, consisting of face-to-face, web facilitated, alternative blended, online learning and flipped learning in terms of their learning style and time management. • For students with sufficient background knowledge, the flipped learning mode provides the best learning performance. • This study could provide administrators, educators and instructors with insights and new approaches in science, technology, engineering and mathematics education and improvements in their course policies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In our contemporary life, various information technologies are changing our lives, and the development of information technology has also provided a certain degree of convenience for the development of education. Now, every country attaches great importance to the development of the informatization of education. This article aims to study how to apply artificial intelligence content and control algorithms to the English listening mode of a flipped classroom. The main purpose of the article is how to make the flipped classroom more intelligent, enrich the content of the classroom, and devote itself to improving children's learning efficiency. This article proposes the application of the PSO algorithm in the flipped classroom to help students learn more intelligently and conveniently in this mode of teaching. They can help children improve their academic performance faster and learn more efficiently. The experimental results of this article show that nearly 65.63% of students are familiar with the teaching method of using animation video to train English listening, and nearly 70% of students are very willing to use this teaching method to learn; using more artificial intelligence fusion control algorithms for us, this teaching mode is used for some simplification and assistance. The average test score of the experimental class (82.95 points) is higher than the posttest score of the control class (79.9 points), the excellence rate of the experimental class is 38%, the pass rate is 100%, and the control class has an excellent rate of 32% in the posttest score. The passing rate was 86.7%. Further analysis shows that, in the posttest scores of the experimental class, the excellent rate and the passing rate have increased, respectively. After the test, the scores of the students in the experimental class have improved greatly compared with the control class. The overall performance of the students has improved significantly. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Therewith, the emergence of scalable, versatile digital learning tools and techniques suggests that manufacturing courses should explore how to maximize the use and value of in-person teaching time. This paper describes the application of a flipped classroom model to undergraduate manufacturing processes courses at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Michigan. In the flipped classroom approach, pre-recorded lecture videos are provided to students, and in-class time is used for hands-on activities and/or labs, thereby promoting discussion and interaction among students and staff. Together, the combination of online preparation and in-person learning is designed to: (1) study manufactured products, and relate observations to fundamental principles; (2) encourage formulation of questions based on open-ended topics; (3) practice written, verbal, and graphical communication skills; and (4) build a layered understanding of manufacturing as a complex system that connects process physics to overarching principles of rate, quality, cost, and flexibility. We also share our experiences teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated a balance of remote and in-person learning, and comment on emerging curriculum elements including use of augmented reality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the recent times, the flipped classroom method is used commonly in higher education where pre-class online activities have a vital role. However, one of the most significant issues is the lack of participation of the students in pre-class online activities. In this study, a Gamified Flipped Classroom (GFC) environment proposes a solution to this issue. A true-experimental design was used in the study and the effects of teaching in this environment on students' online behaviors and achievements were investigated. The participants were fourth-year undergraduate petroleum and natural gas engineering students enrolled in a natural gas engineering course. The experimental group students learned with the gamified flipped classroom (GFC) method, while the control group students learned with the conventional flipped classroom (CFC) method. Data were collected from a natural gas concept test (NGCT), weekly quizzes, and data logs from Moodle. The research results indicated that teaching in the gamified flipped classroom (GFC) method showed a significant increase in the students' participation in the pre-class activities of the flipped classroom compared to the control group. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the achievement levels of the experimental group as compared to the control group. The results of this study provide evidence that the use of gamification elements in the pre-class phase of the flipped classroom method not only enhanced the students' pre-course online behaviour but also significantly improved their achievement. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This work describes the changes in a CU (curricular unit), Numerical Methods, that occurs in the second semester of the second year in the master’s programme of mechanical engineering, in 2020-2021. The methodology used in this CU was obsolete and has been taught with expositive classes and practical classes with little participation of the students. The big challenges are the dimension of the class (112 students), the lack of motivation to the subject of the CU and the fact that the CU appears very early in the teaching programme. This turned out to be even harder with the migration to online teaching, due to the pandemic and the uncertainty of the remaining of the semester (at this point we still don’t know if a blended learning system is going to be possible). The CU is working with some technological resources such as padlet, PollEv, BlackBoard and Ted Ed. The strategies being implemented are Problem-Based Learning (PBL), Audience Response Systems (ARS) and it has been used a partial flipped classroom strategy. Every week there are small videos available, to introduce the subjects and engage the students, and other videos are recorded in the Blackboard platform during the more expositive and complex parts of the classes, as well as exercises (by hand or in MATLAB<sup>TM</sup>). In terms of assessment, there are weekly mini-tests, some of them in MATLAB<sup>TM</sup>, preceded by a preparation quiz in the platform PollEv in a session before the class to maintain the students’ engagement. There is a small project in MATLAB<sup>TM</sup> where the students in teams are encouraged to search for an applied problem from the real world in the suggested routine. There are two planned face-to-face tests, one of them already took place. In the practical classes, the students are divided in smaller classes, where they can practice with the teacher (these classes had now migrated to a face-to-face scenario). The results until this point are very promising, with a wide participation of the students and excellent scores in the mini-tests. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The present work addresses the structuring and application of a teaching-learning model, which explores the interface between eduScrum and active learning methodologies, in particular Project-Based Learning and the Flipped Classroom, in teaching-learning management of projects. Both eduScrum and active learning methodologies bring key concepts such as regular feedbacks, prioritization of content applicable in practice and centralization of the process in the student. Thus, a framework of 5 sprints was structured with 6 classes each to use both approaches in a complementary way, detailing step by step during the research. The application was carried out in the discipline Project Management and Multidisciplinary Teams in the semester of 2020/1, offered by the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Brasília. The steps involved in the project were: literature review; application of a questionnaire to identify the requirements of the discipline in the students' view; structuring the model and the necessary adaptations for remote education, depending on the pandemic caused by the Coronavirus; application and evaluation of the developed model. The implementation of the model throughout the semester was highlighted by the positive reception by the students and the relevance of the projects developed by the groups and allowed to identify opportunities for improvement in the dynamics of the activities, in the schedule and in the evaluation method. In the end, an anonymous questionnaire was obtained with the students who took the course a Net Promoter Score of 82 points and an average satisfaction of 4.5 on a scale of 1 to 5. These results points to the potential of using this method of non-traditional teaching in engineering education. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Although many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of flipped learning in terms of performance enhancements, there is a lack of research investigating the factors that can affect students' performance in introductory engineering mathematics courses using flipped learning. This study investigated how different factors, including prior knowledge, learning styles, and types of problems, can affect the flipped classroom students' performance in engineering mathematics. Before and after participating in flipped learning covering the concept of ordinary differential equations, 139 engineering students' testing and survey data were collected. The results showed that, first, two learning styles including converging and assimilating played a major role in problem-solving, and significantly predicted their final test score. Second, when engaging in real-life and non-routine problems individually or in collaboration with group members, students' scores in the post-test were increased. This study concluded that instructors could enhance students' performance in engineering mathematics by integrating flipped learning with their current curriculum, helping students apply the abstract concepts of mathematics to authentic situations, and considering students' learning styles as a factor in successful flipped learning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, flipped classroom as a new type of mixed teaching mode relying on computer technology has changed the traditional teaching mode and formed a teaching process of "learning first and teaching later,"and it has been used in many fields of teaching. Flipped classroom reverses the sequence of traditional teaching knowledge transfer and knowledge internalization and improves students' autonomy. However, it is still in the exploratory stage of the specific impact of the flipped classroom teaching model on college students' English autonomous learning ability. Therefore, this article proposes a novel college English flipped classroom teaching model based on big data and deep neural networks. The study has selected a total of 230 students in two classes of the second-year English major of a university as the research objects. Data are utilized to investigate the changes of the two groups of students' English autonomous learning ability and English academic performance, to explore the specific changes of college students' English autonomous learning ability and its influencing factors through interviews, and to predict and effectively analyze the weight of influencing factors through the deep neural network. This research enriches the theoretical research results of college students' English autonomous learning ability under the flipped classroom teaching model, provides reference for the cultivation of college students' English autonomous learning ability, and has certain reference significance for the optimization of the flipped classroom teaching model. The proposed research will support researchers and practitioners at college and university level. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a technique in use at the Faculty of Engineering, UWI (Mona), to offer undergraduate engineering classes by combining collaborative Asynchronous Learning Networks (ALNs) and synchronous group interactions, in a flipped classroom setting. The ALN component involves access to online class materials such as recorded lectures, class notes, assigned and reference books and study guides so that students may watch lectures, write their own notes and consult supplemental materials as needed. A multimedia social network group including the instructors, instructional assistants and all students in the class then provides a forum to pose and answer questions and facilitate collaborative discussions of online material. The ALN class lectures and group interaction are complemented by a Synchronous Learning Network (SLN), using face-to-face meetings where possible and optionally, as necessitated over the past year during the on-going Covid-19 pandemic, using synchronous video conferencing tools. This face-to-face or videoconference enabled SLN component essentially constitutes a 'flipped-class room' approach, where lectures are watched at home and homework and problems are done at school. In person or virtually by interactive videoconference, fully exploiting the collaborative benefits of real-time, teacher-student and studentstudent interactions. The synchronous 'flipped-class room' sessions are used for group discussions, collaborative problem solving as well as supervised student assessment purposes. The flipped classroom sessions serve several important purposes in achieving key goals of effective teaching and learning. First, a moderated content specific question and answer discussion and by a mini-quiz with full access to personally authored lecture motivate and ensure diligence in student assimilation of the online class lectures. This sound foundation then empowers students to use the ALN lecture and supplemental material to successfully complete class assignments and projects in an interactive and collaborative setting. The in-person session also allows the for progressive and rigorous evaluation of learning via periodic tests based on personally completed class-assignments, comprehensive in-term examination(s) with no notes or textbook allowed, and a cumulative closed book, closed notes final examination based on the entire course material covered. The paper also provides general observations on the overall teaching and learning effectiveness and student performance as well as preliminary anecdotal student feedback on the HASLN approach. Finally, we motivate the benefit of implementing the HASLN techniques in High School and pre-college education for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) classes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Many research showed that both approaches were efficient in conjunction in an active learning perspective. However, we observe that few games have been designed with use in the flipped classroom in mind, and there is therefore potential to improve the flipped classroom experience by approaching the development and integration of games with a more holistic and adaptive experience in mind. For that purpose, a focus group of educators was assembled for a pilot project and their educational practices, objectives and gaming experience analyzed. Following this investigation, co-constructed game design choices were made to try and develop a game that could support a variety of subjects and learning experience in the FC. Although the focus group answers showed that a fully adaptive gaming experience needed, for reasons of flexibility, to lean towards a gamified platform, the final design solution can have the potential to support fully the flipped classroom experience for any subject or class desired. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The subject of study determined the purpose of the study, which is to describe implementation technology of the flipped classroom, focused on the study of the theory of functions of a complex variable. A pedagogical experiment was held at TPU, during which students who studied using the technology of the flipped classroom before a lecture on a specific topic made a summary of this lecture, the material of which was placed in the LMS MOODLE as a PDF file. Students were proposed to take notes of the lecture (if necessary, make notes about what was not clear, so that they could discuss it in class). At the same time, they should have left space in the notebook for proving theorems or for solving examples that demonstrate the use of theoretical material. A pedagogical experiment demonstrated that the use of technology of the flipped classroom improved student achievement. This technology allowed us to present the theoretical material in full.

	abstract = {The trend of incorporating flipped learning to create active and effective learning environments has become increasingly popular in higher education in recent years. Existing research in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) suggests that students have a positive attitude towards flipped learning. This positive attitude strongly correlates to the perceptions of enhanced motivation, effective learning, and engagement. However, most of the studies on flipped learning in higher education only yield quantitative results. Students' perceptions of their experiences of online learning, in particular of their motivation in flexible and effective learning environments are rarely investigated qualitatively to provide in-depth reasoning. Recent online pedagogy has integrated adaptive learning tools to meet individual learning needs. This study focused on both flipped and adaptive learning strategies implemented in an online thermodynamics class. The flipped classroom freed up lecture time for interactive and effective online learning activities. This study aimed to interview, analyze, and explore underlying themes of college students' perceptions and experiences in an online Thermodynamics class using flipped and adaptive learning. A total of 14 out of 54 students volunteered for a semistructured interview. Students from the Students Assessing Teaching and Learning program were trained to conduct the individual interviews and transcribe the recording for analysis. Three researchers analyzed the data using thematic analysis. The results indicate that flipped learning enhances the students' learning experience and perceptions of learning effectiveness, ownership, and motivation. Nevertheless, applying adaptive learning with predesigned learning algorithms can cause student frustration. Through examination of the three psychological needs of the self-determination theory, adaptive learning can be perceived as a positive experience if a student's extrinsic motives align well with his needs and values. The qualitative findings of this study not only demonstrate the effectiveness of modern learning technologies in an engineering course, but also provide a foundation for future pedagogical design. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Many engineering professors teach their classes without having received previous training in psycho-pedagogy and neuroscience. While a few of them have received some form of pedagogical training during their academic career, the vast majority have not acquired any training in the field of didactics, that is, in the science of teaching. Teaching is a difficult task, and teaching effectively is even more difficult. Much literature exists on different teaching-learning methodologies that have been empirically tested in engineering studies. However, practically none of these works make reference to the main factor in any learning process: How does the human brain learn? This paper analyses learning from the perspective of its three main phases (motivation, attention, memorization), and how these phases should be addressed in a lecture, since many of the Engineering classes at universities around the world are given as lectures. The current knowledge of neuroscience is used in the paper to provide twelve recommendations on how a lecture should be successfully given in Engineering Degrees. For the selection of these twelve tips, we use two criteria: They must be relevant in a lecture, and they must have a neuroscientific basis, which is explained in the framework of the paper. The relationship between the twelve tips and the seven principles of good practice in undergraduate studies enunciated by Chickering and Gamson has also been established. The relation of each tip with the learning phases to which it refers is explained, and an example of how to apply it in a lecture is given. This paper presents a new way of working in engineering education: How to apply the knowledge provided by neuroscience to the teaching-learning process. This work provides some ideas about how this can be done in a lecture, but it is also necessary to conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of the twelve tips proposed herein. It is likewise necessary to carry out similar work for other teaching methodologies such as PBL, flipped classroom or service-learning. The future of education cannot be developed without taking into account the functioning of the human brain or by applying educational practices that are unsupported by scientific evidence of their effectiveness. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom is an alternative approach to the conventional lecture by introducing collaborative tasks in the class to promote active learning. The theoretical lecture was delivered to the students through videos, which they watch at home before the class. The implementation of this method at the undergraduate level especially in engineering courses was reported to be lacking. This study presents a five-semester observation in the Rigid Body Dynamics course, during which the first two semesters were conducted using the conventional approach, and the following three semesters were flipped. Three indicators were measured to evaluate the effectiveness of the method: the percentage of failures, the number of student enrolments, and the lecturer evaluation score. There is strong evidence showing that flipped classroom has increased the student's performance. Also, it was found that the students prefer this method compared to the conventional approach. This study demonstrates that the flipped classroom approach can be implemented in engineering courses with a good chance of success. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the current educational scenario existing at the higher education institutions, where the academic schedules are packed with lot of student activities and other skill development training activities, the faculties are facing difficulties in completing the syllabus, which is the bare minimum requirement expected of them. This leads to faculty resorting to the traditional lecturing techniques even though the scope of implementing active and co-operative learning strategies in the today’s classroom scenario is higher. Many past studies have indicated that the traditional lecturing techniques do not help in the improvement of student performance and satisfaction. This article reports on a study which employed a peer assisted flipped classroom technique to improve the performance of students in an engineering course offered in the final year of B.E Civil engineering program. The flipped classroom strategy involved in this study consisted of 28 students watching recorded lectures along with their peer pairs before attending the regular class hours. The regular class time was split between completing a handout based on the recorded lecture, group discussion and doubt clearing by the course instructor. The statistical analysis on the pre-test and post-test scores of the students obtained before and after the implementation of the research technique revealed that there is a significant improvement in the performance of the students compared to the traditional teaching techniques. The research technique is found to have a positive effect on the performance of students based on the results concluded in the study. The research revealed that the peer assisted flipped classroom technique can be implemented as one of the active learning strategy to increase the performance level of students. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The concept of teaching through the flipped classroom technique is always considered as one of the most important in higher education in the Indian context. It enables undergraduates to gain fundamental learning even before they attend the class and also facilitate educators to manage discussions among the undergraduates during the classroom interaction hours. Likewise, the undergraduates share their insights gained during such discussions in the classroom. It is seen that the majority of the Engineering courses are lacking in implementing the blended learning approach into their curriculum. The case study presented in this research paper is an attempt to prepare undergraduates before they attend their class to provide further speculation in the subject matter. The educator disseminated the learning course material for the chosen programming subject for five topics even before the beginning of the regular classes in a semester and interacted with the undergraduates during the hours meant for classroom interaction in the semester. From the observations, it is found that undergraduates have actively participated in the flipped classroom approach and also lead to improved learning outcomes of the undergraduate over the span of time during the semester. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The flipped classroom model refers to an instructional approach in which students watch educational videos at home and homework assignments are done in class. Effect sizes were calculated for the research designs post-test only , pre-test-post-test (time) and pre-test-post-test with control group (treatment) . The meta-analytical findings for the condition treatment confirm the effectiveness of flipped classroom on student achievement in comparison to traditional instruction (Cohen's d = 0.42, 95 % CI [0.20 0.63], Z = 3.81, p < .001). Moderator analyses on the effect sizes time show stronger effects for subjects in the STEM area (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) than for foreign languages and humanities. The effect sizes were also higher for shorter intervention studies than for longer ones and if quiz at home had been left out. Moderator analyses on the effect sizes post-test only and treatment make clear that the effect sizes for intervention studies without a learning management system are higher than with a learning management system. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for educational practice. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines the subjective and quantitative outcomes of the introduction of the flipped classroom approach to two engineering subjects at the University of Melbourne. In this approach, lectures are delivered online as opposed to the traditional method of being provided in person. To facilitate learning, after each part of an online lecture, students completed an activity to reflect upon and review the content via compulsory questionnaires. Students would then attend formal classes in person (e.g., workshops) in which they would participate in interactive and collaborative activities related to the online lecture material. Surveys were provided to the students at the beginning of the semester to understand their perceptions of different learning activities. The surveys indicate that students who did well on the questionnaires also did well in the subject with a positive trend between questionnaire scores and final grades in both subjects. The survey results suggest that the flipped classroom method could provide students with better learning outcomes for subjects at the university level if implemented in a way that promotes active and student-centered learning. Some recommendations are provided based on the results of this paper for the implementation of the flipped classroom method for future subjects at the university level. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

To this end, we allocated ten students to a flipped microlecture and twelve to a traditional lecture setting; conducted pre and post-tests; and, organised a focus group. Results show a positive effect of the flipped microlecture class on the test performance. Students’ qualitative evaluations also indicate their satisfaction with increased control over learning, reduced discomfort of traditional lecture settings, enhanced classroom interaction, and better knowledge retention. These findings resonate with blended learning and multimedia literature and support future decision making about microlectures in engineering education. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flipped classroom has been increasingly adopted in engineering education. However it appears relatively challenging to deploy flipped classroom in the large classes which is characterized by student diversity in backgrounds and understanding levels. A possible solution is to promote peer instruction, through which students are promoted to learn with/from each other. This paper presents a learning platform, the P2P platform, that personalizes and guides peer interaction in a flipped classroom. Based on the student feedback, the platform functions to form small study groups, where students engage themselves in learning with and from each other. Meanwhile, the platform generates and forwards the instructor analytics reports of student learning progress and performance, so that the instructor can make informed decision to redesign and adjust the teaching. The P2P platform is described with respect to its system architecture, key functions, core algorithms, and graphical user interface. The P2P platform is validated based on an introductory engineering design course (n=282). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the unrivalled advances in information and communication technologies, teaching and learning methods have substantially evolved over years. This has led to several novel and creative ideas and thoughts, making several channels available for gaining knowledge of academic curricula as well as post-graduate career development. In this paper, we share our experience on a case study for shifting the traditional approach of teaching a course on Web Application Engineering and Development, which is a commonly-populated regularly-offered course on most software engineering, computer science, and information technology related programs in many worldwide universities. The course material and assessment methods are redesigned to foster more active and collaborative social learning. The instructor’s role has changed to act as a coach guiding students to gain the required knowledge and achieve the expected learning outcomes through inquiry-based learning using mashup and Web 2.0 technologies to engage students, deal with student differences and mange their communications. The described approach has been approved as part of an innovative teaching initiative program at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Saudi Arabia, for online classes during the global pandemic of COVID-19 coronavirus. This paper also shares the instructor’s and students’ perspectives on comparing virtual classrooms to traditional faceto-face classrooms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Students have different learning approaches and acquire knowledge in different ways owing to their varied perceptions and grasping abilities. Treating students equally, following the traditional teacher-cantered approach, may not be effective and calls for innovations in knowledge dissemination. This article takes a student-centric approach to implement a ‘flipped classroom’ model in an engineering course for constructivism (i.e. experience-based learning), and students’ personalized learning. The performance of the flipped classroom approach is compared with the traditional lecturing approach using four lenses: students’ grades, students’ reflection using three surveys at different stages during the semester, teacher’s observation, and peer observation. In most of the existing approaches, analysis of the qualitative survey data is performed manually without computer assistance, and therefore these are criticized for being primeval and instinctive. In this research, a novel approach, based on fuzzy logic, is devised to evaluate the qualitative survey responses from the students. It is shown in this research, that the linguistic survey responses can be summarized in an index more meaningfully using a fuzzy logic-based approach. The results further showed that the flipped classroom model helped students to improve their grades and enhance engagements with their teacher and their peers. Increased interaction, during interactive class activities, was instrumental in evolving students’ problem-solving and critical analysis skills towards better learning experiences. Furthermore, students’ survey results, analyzed using the novel fuzzy indexing and a non-parametric statistical test showed that the intervention in the form of flipped classes was effective and found to be statistically significant. The findings of this study may help other academics, endeavoring for experience-based, and students’ personalized learning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

From the perspective of reforming teaching practice, a small private online course (SPOC)-based flipped classroom teaching mode of Installation Engineering Cost in Hebei Agricultural University based on the OBE concept was built, following the basic process of teaching goals–teaching activities–learning evaluation. These teaching activities including pre-class, in-class, and after-class steps had run for 2 school years on big and small class scales. A questionnaire survey was conducted to analyze the teaching effect after 2 school years of teaching practice. The results showed that through the SPOC-based flipped classroom teaching mode, final exam scores of students in the Urban and Rural Construction Institute were, on average, 11.11 points higher than those in the Modern Science and Technology Institute in 2017–2018 school year, and 8.32 points higher than those from traditional classroom teaching, indicating that the SPOC-based flipped classroom teaching on the small class scale had a positive effect on mastery of knowledge. Questionnaire results showed that students' awareness, participation, and satisfaction in flipped classrooms were higher than in traditional classrooms. Compared to the big class teaching, the implementation of small class teaching was more conducive to the cultivation of students' comprehensive abilities. The SPOC-based flipped classroom teaching mode provides a reference for blended teaching in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In this sense, it is important to gain more knowledge of how such methods are actually implemented. Objective. The aim of this study is to systematically examine the literature on the use of the flipped classroom method in SE teaching. Method. To achieve the study objective, we conducted a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) starting with 769 studies. After the filtering process, we extracted data from 26 primaries studies, which meet the study selection criteria. Results. We found papers from 2008 to 2020, most of them published in SE conferences. In fifteen papers, the content is delivered to the students before class, nine of them using a specific system developed to this task. We found that the in-class activities follow three main strategies: (1) project-based learning (38.3%); (2) problem-based learning and self-direct learning (50.0%); and (3) team-based learning (7.7%). Reviewed studies reported challenges in implementing FC in ES course such as overworked and time-constrained professors and difficulty in sustaining student motivation. Also, we found studies reporting improvements in student learning and motivation Conclusion. Based on our findings, we conclude the use of an active method has proved to be useful for in-class practical activities, especially related to the software development field. We also observed that adaptive educational content delivery has not been explored in software engineering studies with flipped classes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has become highly relevant in applications across all industries, and specialists in the field are sought urgently. As it is a highly interdisciplinary field, requiring knowledge in computer science, statistics and the relevant application domain, experts are hard to find. Large corporations can sweep the job market by offering high salaries, which makes the situation for small and medium enterprises (SME) even worse, as they usually lack the capacities both for attracting specialists and for qualifying their own personnel. In order to meet the enormous demand in ML specialists, universities now teach ML in specifically designed degree programs as well as within established programs in science and engineering. While the teaching almost always uses practical examples, these are somewhat artificial or outdated, as real data from real companies is usually not available. The approach reported in this contribution aims to tackle the above challenges in an integrated course, combining three independent aspects: first, teaching key ML concepts to graduate students from a variety of existing degree programs; second, qualifying working professionals from SME for ML; and third, applying ML to real-world problems faced by those SME. The course was carried out in two trial periods within a government-funded project at a university of applied sciences in south-west Germany. The region is dominated by SME many of which are world leaders in their industries. Participants were students from different graduate programs as well as working professionals from several SME based in the region. The first phase of the course (one semester) consists of the fundamental concepts of ML, such as exploratory data analysis, regression, classification, clustering, and deep learning. In this phase, student participants and working professionals were taught in separate tracks. Students attended regular classes and lab sessions (but were also given access to e-learning materials), whereas the professionals learned exclusively in a flipped classroom scenario: they were given access to e-learning units (video lectures and accompanying quizzes) for preparation, while face-to-face sessions were dominated by lab experiments applying the concepts. Prior to the start of the second phase, participating companies were invited to submit real-world problems that they wanted to solve with the help of ML. The second phase consisted of practical ML projects, each tackling one of the problems and worked on by a mixed team of both students and professionals for the period of one semester. The teams were self-organized in the ways they preferred to work (e.g. remote vs. face-to-face collaboration), but also coached by one of the teaching staff. In several plenary meetings, the teams reported on their status as well as challenges and solutions. In both periods, the course was monitored and extensive surveys were carried out. We report on the findings as well as the lessons learned. For instance, while the program was very well-received, professional participants wished for more detailed coverage of theoretical concepts. A challenge faced by several teams during the second phase was a dropout of student members due to upcoming exams in other subjects. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a framework to evaluate and design flipped classroom activities for data science and management courses. Variants of flipped classrooms have been employed in STEM fields with great success in students' learning outcomes. Research shows that flipped classrooms would improve students' learning if it is implemented following rigorous procedures of an efficient instructional design. As a result, one of the critical focus of current flipped classroom research is what factors educators need to consider when designing a flipped learning environment. Currently, educators incorporate various factors such as pre-recorded video lecture, group activity as a trial and error basis and adjust these factors based on their own experience and students' feedback. On the other hand, the emergence of big data expects a new graduate to demonstrate mastery of concepts and skills for data acquisition, management, and analysis of inference from data when they enter the workforce. Currently, there is no systematic approach available to design a flipped classroom that is for the data science and management courses. In this research, we develop a framework first to investigate and evaluate the flipped classroom factors mentioned in the literature and identify a few that are most relevant to the two data management courses at our institute. Then, we classify each course topics into broader categories. So that the flipped classroom model can be developed for each category. For the flipped classroom for each category, we identify the pre-class and in-class activities to meet a certain learning objective for that topic category for each course. To evaluate the effectiveness of different factors as well as our flipped classroom models, students' performance data, interviews, and surveys are conducted. This process is transformative and can be employed by other STEM disciplines to find the most influential factors to design effective flipped learning classrooms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Institutions of Higher Education (IES) have maintained the master class as a traditional teaching method, where the teacher is the center of the learning process and his main function is to transmit information within the classroom. However, thanks to technology, didactic technological tools are currently being included to transform learning spaces and reduce low rates of academic performance. IES have begun to configure new hybrid learning environments, where they seek to incorporate gamification to motivate and keep students engaged during their learning inside and outside the classroom. The objective of this work is to present a game proposal that will be adapted in the context of a flipped class. For this, a board game is proposed that will include gamification elements, where it will seek to promote student motivation and observe the impact produced on their learning. Finally, the result was useful theoretical foundations that allow to promote the use of gamification in hybrid learning environments, to later develop an efficient and effective gamified application that helps increase student motivation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The blended learning method with its supporting electronic tools is a very well-known approach in academic education. In most of its practical applications, direct face to face contacts between students and the teacher as well as students with each other in groups are important elements in the organization of lectures and classes. This is of particular importance in conducting laboratory classes in teaching process for engineers. However, the COVID-19 lockdown in the spring of 2020 closed schools, universities and completely eliminated the possibility of direct interpersonal contacts. These extraordinary circumstances forced changes in the organization of the teaching process, in particular the introduction of distance learning. Therefore, this paper proposes a modified blended learning method as well as describes a case study on its introduction in the education of building automation engineers at a technical university. A new organizational structure of this modified method is presented, with discussion of tools and methods of active distance learning, introduced during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Finally, some experiences, general reflections along with the identification of the preferred forms of distance learning by students are presented. The future works are briefly described as well. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Recent engineering education research has found improved learning outcomes when instructors engage students actively (e.g., through practice problems) rather than passively (e.g., in lectures). As more instructors shift toward active learning, research needs to identify how different types of activities affect students' cognitive engagement with concepts in the classroom. In this study, we investigate the effects of prompting novice students to draw when solving problems, a professional practice of engineers. Purpose: We investigate whether implementing instructional prompts to draw in an active learning classroom (a) increases students' use and value of drawing as a problem-solving strategy and (b) enhances students' problem-solving performance. Method: We compared survey data and exam scores collected in one undergraduate class that received prompts to draw in video lectures and in-class problems (drawing condition) and one class that received no drawing prompts (control condition). Results: After drawing prompts were implemented, students' use and value of drawing increased, and these effects persisted to the end of the semester. Students were more likely to draw when provided drawing prompts. Furthermore, students who received prompts outperformed students who did not on exam questions that target conceptual understanding. Conclusions: Our findings reveal how implementing drawing prompts in an active learning classroom may help students engage in drawing and solve problems conceptually. This study contributes to our understanding of what types of active learning activities can improve instructional practices in engineering education. Particularly, we show how prompts that foster authentic engineering practices can increase cognitive engagement in introductory-level engineering courses. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {STEM education is essential but challenging. Educators generally believe that both practical work and flipped learning facilitate STEM education. Practical work is useful in establishing linkages among STEM-related disciplines as well as the connections between knowledge and the real-life problems while flipped learning allows teachers to spend more in-class time on individual guidance and feedbacks. This study aims at studying the mechanism of how they could benefit STEM education and their interactions when used together. In this study, a strategy called flipping–practical–discussion was employed in a STEM lesson among twenty senior high school students in grade eleven. The research follows a qualitative design and individual interviews were conducted on three students and the teacher who conducted the lecture. The result shows that the pre-class video of flipping classroom could act as a medium in providing the pre-requisite knowledge and skills which facilitate the practical work and discussions. Although there is a lack of support in the pre-class section, the questions aroused during watching the video could serve as the raw materials for subsequent class activities, therefore keeping students more focused in the in-class session and potentially boosting the effect of the practical work and discussions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Combined with the characteristics of the electronic experiment course system, this paper proposes the electronic experiment teaching method based on the flipped classroom. Through the flipped classroom model design before, during and after class, the two-way interaction between teachers and students in the electronic experiment teaching is realized, which effectively improves students' interest in learning, promotes students' cooperation and self-learning ability.

Our study encompasses two academic courses, in the years 2017 and 2018, and involves a total number of 434 students and 6 lecturers, placing this among the largest studies on flipped-classroom to date. The paper also reports on the production of the videos used with the flipped-classroom methodology, recorded by the lecturers in informal settings, and provides several lessons learned in this regard. The results of the study, backed by a solid statistical analysis of the data, demonstrate the suitability of the flipped-classroom methodology for laboratory sessions in the subject course. Among other results, our analysis concluded that students had on average 24 more minutes per session to solve in-class exercises with the flipped-classroom methodology; more than 70% of the students considered that the quantity, duration and didactic content of the videos were (very) appropriate; and 9 out of every 10 students would prefer this methodology in the laboratory sessions of future courses rather than a traditional face-to-face approach. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Background: There is a need for longitudinal studies of the flipped classroom approach in general. Although a few cross-sectional studies show that a flipped classroom approach can increase student learning by providing more time for other in-class activities, such as active learning, such studies are also rare in the context of teaching software engineering. Intended Outcomes: To assess the usefulness of a flipped classroom approach in teaching software engineering. Application Design: The study was conducted at an international master's program in Sweden, given in English, and partially replicated at a university in Africa. Findings: The results suggest that students' academic success, as measured by their exam grades, can be improved by introducing a flipped classroom to teach software engineering topics, but this may not extend to their subjective liking of the material, as measured by student evaluations. Furthermore, the effect of the change in the teaching methodology was not replicated when changing the teaching team. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Contribution: An improved inverted lecturing (IIL) framework based on blending flipped lectures and hands-on experiments provides instructional benefits, compared to traditional teaching (TT) and inverted lecturing (IL), in an introductory course in digital systems. Background: IL has proven more effective than TT in improving student learning in engineering courses, but has mostly been used for theory sessions. The impact of combining inverted lectures and hands-on experiments on student learning has not still been thoroughly assessed in engineering courses. Intended Outcomes: Attendance, marks, and satisfaction should improve for students in IL-based theory lectures, compared with those receiving TT, and should improve still further for students receiving the IIL-based method. Workload both for student and instructor should not increase significantly. Application Design: The three methods were compared in six consecutive offerings of the course. In the first two, TT was used for both theory and laboratory classes; in the next two, IL was used for theory lectures; and in the final two offerings the IIL-based scheme was used. The instructor, intended learning outcomes (ILOs), course syllabus, and student grading scheme were constant over the six semesters. A total of 184 students with similar backgrounds participated. Findings: Students under the IL- and IIL-based frameworks were more engaged than those receiving TT, and were more satisfied with their learning process. The IIL-based learners achieved the deepest conceptual understanding. Finally, the IL- and IIL-based methods did not significantly increase workload for either the students or the instructor. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Engineering courses typically follow a similar framework for content delivery: preread, lecture, and homework. Innovations are starting to be embraced that increase engagement, student learning, and success. One technique that is being experimented with is the use of the flipped classroom. In the flipped classroom model, students watch videos of the lectures and spend class time working on active learning activities. In this study, the flipped model was applied to a junior level civil engineering course, Structural Analysis, with the goal of increasing student learning and success. A statistical analysis of the attainment of the student learning objectives (i.e., student learning) determined mixed results. Of the seven learning objectives for the course: four increased, two decreased, and one decreased less than one percent. The study found that the flipped model had a positive effect on student success. There was a 7.9% increase in students who earned a C grade or better in the course. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The ever-growing presence of technology is changing not only the way we communicate, work, and entertain ourselves but also the attention span given to individual tasks. Due to the rapid integration of technology, even those who grew up without a cell phone now find themselves 'multi-screening . This is particularly concerning for the digital-native students who are now in college and have different needs in the classroom than previous generations. Known as, Generation Z or Gen-Z, students born between 1996 and 2010 are the majority of engineering students today. As they disrupt traditional college lecturing practices, educators are researching new pedagogies to best fit these students. One of these methods is 'flipped' classrooms. This instructional method moves learning to video lectures for at-home, self-paced learning, whereas class time is reserved for activities or practice of the material. The content of a software-based undergraduate simulation course was converted to a flipped classroom environment for half of the course material. The main objective of this research pilot project is to investigate the impact of video length and video activities on the retention and understanding of Gen-Z engineering students for a software-based simulation course. Results show that students are more likely to watch medium-length videos than short-length videos, but those who do watch short-length videos have better learning outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The role of cognitive engagement in promoting deep learning is well established. This deep learning fosters attributes of success such as self-efficacy, motivation and persistence. However, the traditional chalk-and-talk teaching and learning environment is not conducive to engage students cognitively. The biggest impediment to implementing an environment for deep learning such as active-learning is the limited duration of a typical class period most of which is consumed by lecturing. In this paper, best practices and strategies for cognitive engagement of students in the classroom are discussed. Several lower level math and aerospace engineering courses were redesigned and offered during the academic year at a historically black university. The learning strategies in these redesigned courses included the 'flipped pedagogical model which allowed the integration of the active-learning strategy in the classroom. The research study is to determine the impact of these redesigned courses on student academic performance and persistence in STEM courses. The efficacy of the design of the flipped approach was also investigated. A between-group quasi-experimental research design was used for comparing student academic performance in traditional classroom (control group) and redesigned classroom (intervention group). A within-subject, repeated measures design was also used to assess the impact on the students' self-regulated learning. A validated instrument was used to measure the effect of the redesigned learning environment on the motivational beliefs and self-regulated learning. Data on the academic performance of the students were collected. Analyses of these data indicated a significant impact on student academic performance. A positive change in student motivation and self-regulated learning was observed. Data analysis also validated the design of the intervention.

	abstract = {This work in progress paper poses the research question: what are the motivations and outcomes that lead undergraduate electrical engineering students to volunteer as teaching assistants (TAs)? While graduate students have a long history of serving as TAs, the Electrical & Computer Engineering department at a large public university has replaced virtually all of their graduate teaching assistants with undergraduates. Many of this department's courses are in the hybrid flipped format, wherein the in-class lecture is replaced with active learning time in which motivated teaching assistant labor can be the difference between positive and negative student experience [1]. In these courses in this department, most undergraduate TAs have been observed to volunteer many more hours than those for which they are paid. Some courses in this department have adopted the practice of having their undergraduate TAs volunteer for their first semesters before being promoted to paid positions. We present a pilot study consisting of five in-depth interviews with former undergraduate TAs, most of whom volunteered for at least one semester, from an Introduction to Signal Processing course. The data collection is ongoing; therefore, our results are not complete. Some preliminary results have been identified through multiple readings for the axes of motivation proposed by Ryan and Deci [2], whose self-determination theory states that intrinsic motivation is enhanced by feeling competent, being autonomous-supported, and having a secure relational base. Once the data set is complete, the results will help us better understand how faculty can support undergraduate TAs and build an environment that motivates them to improve engineering classrooms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Mechanics of Materials course has been offered in flipped modality for the past few years at the University of Connecticut. The main objectives for developing this flipped course were to enhance the learning quality in large-enrolment classes and to promote inclusive teaching by providing online course contents to all students. However, there were obstacles observed in offering flipped engineering courses in large classes (over 100 enrollments), such as providing efficient interactions between teacher-student and student-student, aligning students' progress with the class schedule, and maintaining class engagement. In addition, lack of 3-dimensional visualization, repetitive conceptual mistakes, and plagiarism in homework submissions were seen among students in this engineering classroom. Different learning tools have been tried and tested by the instructor during the past 6 years to address the above obstacles, enhance active participation of students, and improve students' class experience. The success or failure of these methods has been evaluated through the data collected as part of formal and informal students' evaluation of teaching (SET). The course contents are delivered via short videos outside of class. The class time is used to review more challenging concepts and includes a short recitation of the lecture material followed by problem solving done by the instructor and the students individually or in groups. The mid semester evaluation of the class revealed that more than 75 percent of students prefer the flipped class over traditional teaching. They indicated that problem solving activities and lecture videos are the most beneficial class components in the students' learning. To enhance the students' visualization, foam models and Augmented Reality (AR) are being used. Only 50 percent of students found AR activities (using their smart device) helpful. Pictures from real life applications of each engineering topic were collected and shared via social media (Facebook) in the past classes. Few students showed interest to share pictures or comment on the class Facebook page. Students' participation increased when these pictures were displayed and discussed during class. Smart Book (containing the online homework platform) was replaced by old fashion paper submission. This platform was selected by the instructor to address the issue of plagiarism as it offers algorithmic problems to each student. The survey showed that more than 80 percent of students prefer the online homework platform (due to instant feedback and comfort of multiple submissions). The teacher assistants were able to spend their time interacting with each student rather than grading homework. Class assessments include online quizzes, midterm exams, and in-class assignments. The main objectives for in-class assignment are encouraging students to watch videos before attending the class and interacting with peers. More than 70 percent of students claimed that team effort enhances their learning and class experience. The students' perception about effectiveness of each learning tool, the rate of class attendance in sequential semesters, and students' participation in class activities will be compared and presented. Other techniques used to minimize common engineering errors among students will be shared. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

An approach to performing a quantitative, objective, and real-time measurement of student engagement in the STEM classroom is proposed to initiate a discussion of the concept and use expert opinions of other faculty to guide progress of the work. This will be realized by an engagement measurement system (EMS). The approach observes biometric data from the students and is multi-dimensional in that it incorporates facial expressions, eye gaze, and hand/head/body movement captured by camera, in addition to pulse captured by a wristband device. From these data, a machine-learning model is trained to classify student engagement. Engagement is classified from behavioral, emotional, and cognitive aspects. The ability to measure student engagement can be used by the instructor to tailor the presentation of material in class, identify course material that engages and disengages with students, and identify students that are engaged or disengaged and at risk of failure. Further, this approach allows quantitative comparison of teaching methods, such as lecture, flipped classrooms, classroom response systems, etc. such that an objective metric can be used to close the loop on teaching evaluation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Traditional course delivery, with daily in-class lecture and a textbook for reference, presents a number of shortcomings. In traditional lecture, students must transcribe notes from the board, which may take their focus away from the critical thinking associated with trying to understand the material. Additionally, students tend to not use textbooks as the instructor intends, but rather choose to pattern match examples to homework problems, which again limits their deeper understanding of course content. Instructor-developed workbooks have the ability to remedy some of these shortcomings, either as a replacement for or supplement to an existing course textbook. The present paper discusses the implementation of course workbooks into a number of sophomore through senior level Mechanical and Construction Engineering courses at The Citadel. These course workbooks act as a more focused and condensed resource for students to use throughout the course. While these workbooks have no resale value, they typically cost approximately 10% of the price of a course textbook, depending on a variety of customization options and number of pages. Most students do not feel that the workbooks are a large financial burden, and they tend to use their workbooks for note taking, problem solving, and studying for exams. These workbooks have been adopted by 6 faculty members across 8 courses and take a variety of different forms, which will be discussed in this paper. This initiative has spread organically through the department as a solution to a variety of issues regularly faced by the faculty. In some implementations, these workbooks have been helpful in reducing pre-class faculty preparation, as it eliminates the need for printing daily handouts, both for in-class exercises in a flipped class and as example problems in a traditional lecture. In other implementations, the workbooks contain lecture material so that students spend less time copying notes and more time engaging with the professor as they explain concepts. This caters to a range of different learning styles, as some students still choose to take their own notes, but more audible learners prefer to just listen and follow along in class. The workbooks have also been used to deliver supplemental problems, learning objectives, and hints for problem solving. In the present implementation, students have reported that they find the workbooks valuable, use them to study for exams, follow along with lecture more closely, and work ahead more. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This paper describes the partial flipping of two electrical and computer engineering laboratory courses and evaluates the students' performance under the flipped teaching approach. The primary motivation that drove the first author to flip these classes was the desire to tailor class time to students' needs, questions, and experimentation. Both partially-flipped courses are composed of equally challenging modules that cover different topics in digital signal processing and electronic circuit design. This study utilizes data collected from the two courses over the period from summer 2018 to summer 2019. In this paper, we analyzed scores from homework assignments, quizzes, and lab reports to assess the performance of the students on flipped modules versus their performance on regular lecture modules. Lab report quality is an essential measure that can indicate how well the students learned the module topic and their ability to interpret and analyze the results of the experiments. Assessment of lab report scores comparing flipped versus traditional instruction found a significant difference in favor of flipped instruction in both courses. Student interviews were used to measure perceptions of flipped learning, with indications that students positively perceived flipped and active learning techniques. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the results of a pilot study performed on flipping an undergraduate foundation course in engineering into a blended or mixed-mode format. A blended instructional model integrates face-to-face instruction with online instruction. Enhanced student satisfaction and greater student success rates are some of the key benefits of a blended model over a traditional face-to-face model. The effectiveness of the blended instructional model is evaluated through comparative data analysis across two semesters for the course Engineering Analysis: Dynamics taught using a traditional face-to-face format in the first semester and a redesigned blended format in the subsequent semester. Student performance, student engagement and student satisfaction are the three primary criterion used in evaluating the effectiveness of the blended delivery model. Results of this study are very positive, with, 85% of the students reporting being satisfied with the redesigned course structure and delivery. Overall student performance in major assignments shows improvement in the blended class as compared to the regular class, thus indicating better knowledge retention in the redesigned course. Finally, the redesigned course shows active class engagement as obtained from video analytics data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This work-in-progress paper reports on the effects of alternative course design and instructional methods in the engineering classroom. The primary method of delivery in undergraduate engineering classrooms remains the traditional lecture format, or teacher-centered instruction, despite evidence that active learning, or student-centered teaching practices, are significantly more effective. Catalyzed by the overwhelming research support for more active learning methods and the promise for creating these opportunities through alternative course models, there has been a more recent shift towards experimentation in delivery and course structure, including strategies such as flipping course content. Flipped course design allows instructors to maintain delivery of critical theoretical and background information by presenting this material to the students outside of formal classroom time, thus preserving time in-class for more active learning and problem-based activities. The flipped learning course design continues to gain popularity in engineering education; however, large-scale quantitative statistical analysis of student outcomes and achievement in courses taught simultaneously through alternative course designs remains limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of these varied instructional methods by investigating the student achievement outcomes of engineering students enrolled in the same course taught through three different instructional models. The study also aims to assess more specific flipped course design components (video lectures) on student outcomes as well as to evaluate the data through the context of the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) and Constructivist theoretical models. Beginning in the fall of 2018, a 200-level mechanical/aerospace course, Statics, was taught by three different faculty members at a large university in the Southwest. Each of these sections were taught in different ways: (a) traditional lecture format, (b) flipped style classroom, and (c) mixed version, which utilized videos created for the flipped classroom as supplemental material but delivered course content primarily through lecture style. Student-level data were collected for all three of the Statics sections of interest in this study. Data were analyzed to determine if students enrolled in flipped or mixed sections experienced improved achievement outcomes greater than their traditional-lecture peers. Initial data showed that the mixed course design had the greatest impact on student achievement as measured by grade distribution, DEW rates, and student performance on class assignments, quizzes, and exams. The flipped and mixed courses were associated with greater improvement for DEW rates, in comparison to the traditional lecture course. Additional data analysis may provide further insight into how specific flipped delivery components, such as video lectures, impact student achievement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Teaching the same material to such mix of students poses an interesting challenge to the instructor. This study aims to evaluate the extent to which the flipped teaching enhances students learning in such courses. The evaluation is based on three components: 1) a survey of 25 Likert questions completed by 46 students, 2) class average grade and pass rate, and 3) student ratings of the course. Findings of the survey indicate that the overall student impression on the flipped model is very positive in terms of classroom learning and engagement as well as self-directed learning. We found no significant difference between the opinions of different student populations, specifically good programmers versus weak programmers, and CS students versus non-CS students. Course ratings and grades were compared against older offerings of the same course taught by the same instructor who was using traditional lecturing. Results confirms the survey findings and show improved class grades, pass-rates, and student satisfaction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Based on the disadvantages of the teaching of civil engineering computer aided drawing (CAD) course and the pressure of continuous compression of class hours, the teaching reform scheme of CAD is presented in three aspects including teaching means, teaching methods and evaluation methods. According to different knowledge points in CAD teaching, 121 micro-videos with averaged duration of 3–5 minutes were recorded. Then a network course named computer drawing micro-course was developed on the platform of Chaoxing Xuexitong, which supports online study on personal mobile devices such as mobile phones and iPad in fragmentated time. Based on the micro-videos, the task-driven method and flipped classroom are adopted to carry out teaching, which could shorten the class time by 1/4 and focus on the cultivation of students’ innovative learning ability. What’s more, theory examination of CAD is cancelled, but the completion of micro-video self-study, homework, performance in flipped classroom, creation of 3D model and examination on computer are all included in the assessment, aiming to strengthen the management of learning process and the practical drawing ability with computer. Compared with the traditional classes, the pilot classes that adopted the scheme not only shorten the class hour, but also raises the average score of final examination on computer by about 4 scores, which demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed teaching reform scheme. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

One possible approach presents our intensive course on agile software development, applying games in engineering education, within the framework of a one-week pan-European exchange program. First, we briefly introduce the program that's held twice a year, offering about 60 scientific intensive courses in each session. Topics come from the research fields at the partner institutions and focus on engineering, natural sciences, and mathematics. Roughly 4, 000 students from 24 universities in 15 European countries participate in the program annually. Second, we report on the concept and design of our intensive course on agile software development. We apply a flipped classroom setting to acquire the basic knowledge; we use game-based learning for in-class exercises; we foster project-based and collaborative learning for practical implementation. Finally, we outline the project work in our course and share the most inspiring student projects diving into data-driven visualizations and learning analytics. Thus, the participants gain insights into the real-life application of agile project management methods and international collaboration in heterogeneous teams despite the limited course length. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This case study aims to investigate the extent to which the teaching mode called flipped classroom is effective in enabling students to learn fundamental concepts in cost engineering. It adopted a repeated measure design and statistical evaluation to examine the learning approaches that enabled students to master fundamental concepts. It also identified the teaching modes that are effective in helping students to understand and apply fundamental concepts in solving cost engineering problems. The flipped classroom involved students learning one fundamental concept (TC1) via preclass online video clips in their own time, followed by in-class discussion, and applying the fundamental concept in solving problems in a face-to-face (F2F) tutorial setting. Thereafter, they were tested for their mastery of TC1. As a comparison, the same students were taught another fundamental concept (TC2) via the traditional F2F lecture and tutorial settings. The study was repeated in the following academic year, with the teaching methods for TC1 and TC2 switched. The data collected included presurveys and postsurveys of perceived learning approaches, pretests and post-tests, and final examination results. This case study found that students achieve mastery (measured by final examination marks) of fundamental concepts regardless of whether the teaching mode is traditional lectures or flipped classroom. When students adopted a more surface-motive learning approach, they also performed significantly more poorly, regardless of teaching mode. Students who adopted a more deep-strategy learning approach when taught in flipped classroom mode performed better in final assessment. The finding is important because it reveals that the flipped classroom is just as effective as the traditional classroom in helping students to master certain cost engineering fundamental concepts. It is recommended that instructors consider using the flipped classroom to harness technology in education. Students are advised not to adopt surface learning approaches because these are detrimental to their mastery of cost engineering concepts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Its aim is to provide profound knowledge about creating highly flexible but robust CAD models that can self-Adapt to changing requirements to automate routine design tasks. Although already highly activating for the students, input and setup were organized traditionally, i.e. professional skills were developed mainly in the ten attendance phases of the class and the overall course of action has only minor degrees of freedom.

The structured ADDIE (Analysis Design Development Implementation Evaluation) model was used to develop the online materials, in the form of short video lectures, and the in-class teaching and learning activities. A formal resource effectiveness analysis justified the economic viability of flipping lectures with video material, however effects of the flipped classroom on student engagement and student learning were not analysed. This study builds upon the previous work, using data obtained during the semester to analyse how students engaged with the flipped classroom and to determine whether student learning was affected through their exposure to it. Quantitative data such as video viewing statistics, quiz responses and discussion board posts were gathered to give an insight into students' use of the content and interaction with the chosen video-hosting platform, while qualitative data from surveys and focus groups were used to further explore students' attitudes and engagement with the flipped classroom concept and its perceived effect on their learning. The data demonstrated a marked improvement across several engagement factors, which was further backed by formal subject evaluations. Importantly, students perceived their own learning to have become more independent. The outcomes on student learning, in terms of subject academic results, showed a statistically significant shift of grades at both the upper and lower ends of the spectrum, highlighting the potential of the flipped classroom to engage a wide spectrum of students. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This work reports the gamification of an Experimental Physics class, dealing with the concepts of Electric Potential and Electric Field, offered to Engineering students. The narrative was based on the strategy to get out of a bumped car, on the verge of fire and electrified due to a fall of a high voltage cable. We have adopted a Flipped Classroom approach to introduce theoretical contents through videos, verified by quizzes. All activities were scored and after successfully completed, gave access to the technical content of the experiment. The equipment description, electric circuits, gathering and data analysis were made available in videos. The solution to the initial problem was simulated in the laboratory and theoretically justified. The students reported great engagement and interest concerning the class. More than acquiring technical knowledge and simulating a real situation, they were proofed in situations that required decision and assertiveness to solve unexpected problems. Gamification showed to be a suitable methodology capable of engaging students, giving them more than just technical information, but also the opportunity to develop soft skills. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Several universities have adopted flipped learning methods for teaching, offering increased student interaction, and different approaches to course preparation and learning processes. Flipped learning appears particularly well suited for engineering educations, as it can combine active and problem-based learning (PBL) activities. In spring 2019, a research project challenged a 4th semester at the Medialogy BSc programme to a 'flipped and integrated semester', where all courses applied flipped learning, and used the approach to integrate students' coursework into their semester project work. To measure the effect of the flipped and integrated semester approach, the 4th semester teacher team collaborated to include several initiatives, such as cross-course teaching activities, student activities for course- and project-integration, and integration-supporting supervision approaches, etc. Student responses to these changes were diverse, and while a part of the students were positive, there is a definite room for improvement. Most requested improvements included a strong semester structure and planning and an explicitly clear relationship between courses and the project. Flipped and integrated semesters require a lot of planning, communication, need a holistic structure and has to be transparently communicated to students. Also among students' main requests for improvement, were a consistent flipping approach across courses, clear connections between homework preparation material and in-class activities, and the inclusion of short introductory in-class clarification of preparation material before any in-class activities. If properly motivated to follow the steps, students found that the flipped classroom format could increase learning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The unit operations laboratory (lab) in chemical engineering offers a unique learning experience where seniors are exposed to real-world chemical processes. They get hands-on activity on laboratory scaled industrial equipment and better insight into chemical engineering fundamentals that they learned in their sophomore and junior years. In these labs, the students work in groups to conduct the experiment, collect and analyze data, and finally write and present their technical reports. Thus these labs helped toned students' ability to collaborate and improve their writing and oral skills. The problem-solving skills, a core competency skill for an engineering student, do not seem to be much appreciated through these unit labs. To rectify the situation and take full advantage of the unit lab in making the students' problem solvers, we taught the class in a hybrid approach mixing the traditional Model of classroom instruction with the flipped classroom model over a semester. During a semester, students performed three-unit laboratory experiments. Two of them were taught in a traditional way: the instructor provided the background and standard operating procedures for the instrument of that particular experiment. Then, the students in groups conducted the experiment under the instructor's supervision. The third remaining unit laboratory was taught in a flipped classroom model. Each group gathers the background information about the particular laboratory they were assigned to and figured out the working of the instrument by themselves by going over the manual and concept from the book and other online resources in detail. For the first two labs, they were tested by the submission of the individual laboratory report at the end of the experiment. While for the third experiment, in addition to the complete group lab report, each group was assessed every week on building different sections of the report, including objectives and introduction, theory, materials, safety precautions, standard operating procedures, observations tables, results, discussion, and conclusion. Each group was provided with feedback on every section each week to ensure they are going in the right direction. Each group also makes a video, in the end, summarizing the working of their third laboratory before submitting their final group laboratory report. Preliminary data show that the students are much more engaged and better understand the experiment that they performed using the flip-room class model. The traditional way of learning provided them a guideline on how to experiment in an organized manner. In contrast, the flip room class model provided them an opportunity to successfully conduct their experiment on their own without much instruction from the instructor. Thus, we recommend that both teaching methods tradition and flip classroom models improve the students' overall skills and learning outcomes. The proposed hybrid teaching approach is expected to make the students more adept in following a systematic approach towards identifying and solving a problem. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Recent studies indicate that student attendance at lectures drastically reduced both at nationally and internationally, has prompted researchers to introduce new methods in course delivery and classroom engagement. It makes students to gain necessary knowledge before class and allows instructors to guide the students to participate in discussion during the lecture hours. Also, the students share their knowledge during the class. It is observed that most of the Engineering programs have lagged in integrating the blended learning approach into curricula. The present case study is an attempt to prepare students before entering the class and provide deeper thinking in the subject of study. The instructor provided material for the selected subject (fluid mechanics) for eight selected topics before starting of the class and had interaction with the students during the delivery. From the case study carried out, it is found that students actively participated in the flipped teaching approach and also observed that the efficiency of the students improved during the course of delivery. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution or industry 4.0 which is a consequence of the rapid change of information is characterized by ultra-connected and flexible processes in order to develop rapidly a personalized product to be utilized in a limited time. This revolution requires new competencies named the soft skills. So, the challenge for educators is to train students with the soft skills needed in the industry 4.0. This is why; the flipped classroom method with a new structure based on PowerPoint presentation was implemented for the maintenance and operating reliability's course during the first semester of the 2018-2019 academic year. The flipped course was delivered for the industrial engineering class in their fourth year of engineering studies in the National School of Applied Sciences NSAS, Fez Morocco. The flipped classroom method is being implemented in a growing number of higher education institutions, but a new structure is proposed which aims to improve the engineering students' soft skills especially the lifelong learning, critical thinking, curiosity, autonomy and communication and presentation techniques in order to success in this digital age and to meet the industry 4.0 requirements. The results of an anonymous survey and a t test are very satisfactory and show that this method has a very positive feedback from the students. A t test is a statistic test that permits to compare between the means of two groups. For me, I can approve that this method is a rewarding teaching experience with minimum technical, technological and logistical resources, but it requires more effort from the teacher who becomes rather a coach and a facilitator and also from the students. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Every year this scenario undergoes a significant shift, due to demand of market and increment in various challenges as per the requirement of different sets of students. Consequently, revisiting the implementation of educational technology in the teaching and learning process is extremely important. This paper highlights the impact of technology to enhance students’ performance in civil engineering module, in which student-centric approach was followed. The study was conducted on civil engineering students at a private college in Muscat, Oman wherein a flipped teaching approach along with free online interactive tools is employed on most of the topics in a basic civil engineering module. A mixed method of three approaches was utilized in collecting data through various means such as questionnaires on the educational technology implemented during module delivery, records of three controlled groups based on their performance and participation in student-centric classroom activities, data and feedback analysis on students’ coursework and end-of-semester assessments. Findings revealed a significant and positive impact on students’ learning experience and their digital competency.

Computer Science 1 (CS1, 1st semester) and Computer Science 2 (CS2, 2nd semester) were modified in pedagogy and curricula. CS1 and CS2 were traditionally presented in a traditional lecture format and both used Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java as programming language. In the new approach, we implemented the flipped classroom: the student before each class reviews some materials and in class, takes place activities and discussions guided by the teacher. The new content of CS1 is aimed at developing computational thinking and basic programming skills, with JavaScript as the programming language. CS2 focuses on OOP, and more advanced algorithms with Java. The first edition of the CS1 course was completed in July 2019 and showed similar approval results of previous courses. High motivation and engagement of both students and teachers with the new proposal were detected. In this work, the results of the implementation of the CS2 course (second semester of 2019) of the same cohort are presented. Approval results obtained were similar to those of previous CS2 courses, showing also high motivation and commitment. Compliance with the flipped format that was used throughout the year was maintained. Considering that the evaluation has similar difficulties and is thematically equivalent to the previous CS2 course, it is important to notice that with the new plan and flipped approach, at the end of the 2nd semester, students manage two languages (instead of only one) and more programming paradigms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Because of the need to have engineers that can perform detailed economic analysis of projects or investment opportunities, problem solving techniques should be used when teaching this course. The experience of the professor teaching engineering economic analysis for over ten (10) years, motivated a significant change on the way the course was being taught. It started with the concept of flipped classroom for about 70% of the course. This teaching technique was proven with regular size groups of approximately thirty (30) students per session and with mega sessions of approximately sixty (60) students. Feedback received from students shows the teaching strategy is working appropriately and students are taking additional knowledge with them. As of this last Spring semester, due to the pandemic affecting the world, classes were moved to distance learning.

	abstract = {Visible, active, and consistent HSE leadership demonstrated by supervisors and managers is a key component in sustaining excellence in safety performance throughout the company. This paper describes the innovative facilitated learning methodology an oilfield service company has developed to increase the effectiveness of its HSE leadership training. A survey and a series of interviews with supervisors, managers, employees, and contractors was conducted to better understand the key HSE leadership challenges and to learn from HSE leadership success stories. The information gathered was used to re-define the company's HSE leadership training objectives and revise the training curriculum. One of the objectives was to ensure managers and supervisors acquire a comprehensive understanding of the company's HSE rules and tools. Another was to help leaders develop their emotional intelligence skills. This was identified as a critical competence required for leaders to effectively drive desired HSE behavior, motivation, and performance improvements. A learning journey in HSE leadership was developed with facilitated training; one for supervisors and one for managers. Both training classes are designed using a flipped classroom methodology. Key concepts such as transformational leadership are incorporated in on-demand microlearning tools such as videos and infographics. This allows the majority of classroom time to be spent with participants working on activities, team exercises, and team presentations based around realistic workplace case studies. The HSE leadership training for managers is structured around an assignment given to participants as the location manager of a fictitious operational site. The participants have two days to identify the site challenges through weak signals, understanding the culture, and developing a plan to effectively manage HSE. As the participants face barriers to success, facilitators introduce the company's HSE resources, tools, and key leadership skills to help them understand the importance of personnel engagement. The training concludes with teams of participants presenting their risk analysis and remedial work plan for improvement. To continue the learning journey, a toolkit is available with a variety of materials in multiple languages and different formats to assist supervisors and managers in applying the tools and demonstrating the leadership skills acquired during the training. The innovative facilitated learning methodology applied to HSE leadership training has been effective in developing key leadership skills and knowledge of HSE tools and rules. Feedback from participants has indicated an increased retention of knowledge and confidence in the application of these skills with their teams in the workplace, compared with traditional training methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The inverted class methodology is an alternative method for skill development in working undergraduate students and in non-working undergraduate students, and represents an adequate option for developing competences and essential learning such as geometry. In Chile, geometry is part of the basic mathematical curricular line in different areas of professional education for the development of essential skills. This study was conducted on 176 first year mining engineering students and metalurgic engineering students that were taking a geometry class. The results showed improvements in the academic performance of both non-working students and working-students, and comparing both improvements, higher academic performance is obtained from the former. Thus, this work demonstrates the applicability of the inverted class for the education of working students. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The students in engineering institutes are expected to be tech-savvy and have an appetite for technology-based learning. Sadly, most of the courses in the current Indian engineering education scenario are taught using straight lectures where students are made to play a passive role while the teacher takes the center stage. The need of the hour is to get the students out of this passive mode of learning and bring them to the forefront in the teaching-learning cycle. Most often than not, teachers utilize the class time teaching technical intricacies that are crucial to solving problems which leave very little time to do anything else. Hence, the onus falls on the students to apply the learning in the class to solve problems on their own outside the classroom which is far from ideal. The flipped class is a model wherein much of the technical content is delivered outside the classroom via a virtual platform which in turn makes the classroom a congenial place for discussions, problem-solving and promoting active learning in the presence of the teacher. Through this paper, a study has been conducted to bring in this modern technology into engineering education. The objective is to analyze the power of technology in teaching courses that require significant work beyond class hours. The flipped classroom model was applied on 32 final year Post Graduate students through the Android Mobile Application Development course. A fundamental topic was chosen that forms the base to build sophisticated Android Apps. Since it was very difficult to grasp the topic at one go, the class was flipped so that the students get ample time to go through the learning resources and come well prepared for the class. To begin with, the students were given the task of going through a lecture video from one of the NPTEL courses on Modern Application Development. However, the video shared was 22 minutes long and to simplify the learning experiences of students, a 3-minute Introductory video on the course content was shot and posted on the course website so that the students could first go through it before going into the actual learning material. During the lecture hour, an active learning strategy based on In-Class Teams was leveraged to drive home learning. Practicing a disruptive tool like the flipped classroom model shifts the focus from the teacher to the students and assists in restoring the balance. By flipping the class, the students are expected to go through learning material employing self-study and then come prepared for the deliberations in the class. As students go through the gist of the course content in advance, it becomes easy for the teacher to turn into a facilitator and assist in students learning during the lecture hours. Through the assessment of student's interaction, preferences, and performance, the results of this study show that the students learn a whole lot better when technology is harnessed as opposed to the traditional classroom lectures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With solid waste management being such a crucial and tangible issue in the XXI<sup>st</sup> century, a blended learning environment was fashioned in a solid waste engineering module for graduate students. The emphasis was in creating authentic projects in partnership with the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Ministry of Education to increase waste awareness and promote the circular economy across various schools in Singapore. The connection between engagement and authentic learning was verified empirically by means of focus group interviews and questionaires, followed by statistical analysis. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.86 and linear regression coefficient of 0.73 (p value = 0.093) demonstrated the positive correlation between these two factors. Finally, a Bayesian bootstrap approach helped overcome the small sample size and confirmed the satisfying positive relation found between authentic learning and engagement. From focus group interviews, it appeared that most students found that the authentic projects accurately reflected the real world problems. One student commented: “I particularly found the NEA project meaningful and certainly appreciate the effort put in with NEA and the schools to prepare the class for this project. I'm beginning to look for ways as to how I can reduce solid waste myself!”. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It covers many learning techniques suitable for both in and out of the classroom. Some of the types includes peer tutoring, groups discussions (small or large groups), and feedback-based learning. These methods have been proven effective to improve students understanding provided peer learning techniques are well monitored and assisted. In this attempt of implementing peer learning, instructor assisted peer learning is adopted to see the effectiveness of the learning technique. The method is applied to 4th Sem B. Tech. in Computer Engineering in Computer Networks subject. Students are divided into group 0f 5-6 with a mix of fast learner, slow learner and regular (in attending lectures). A problem based on the previously discussed topic was given and asked to solve in a group within the class room. However, initially one member from each group has to come and describe the underlaying theory behind the problem and necessary care to be taken to solve it. After the activity, feedback on the activity is taken to know the reaction of the student. One quiz is also conducted to see the understanding of the topic. Similar quiz is also conducted in another class where the peer learning was not adopted and results are compared. Observation shows that understanding of the topic is better in the class where peer learning was adopted. An analysis of the students? feedback and results are presented in the paper. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The transformation of teaching practices in universities remains necessary to better motivate, involve and promote the success of increasingly "connected" students. These new practices can be off-putting to teachers because of the complexity of their implementation. New practices, such as those in the inverted/flipped classroom model, which consists of reversing the nature of inclassroom and out-of-class activities, are well documented in the pedagogical literature; however, few empirical studies are available that allow us to objectively analyze their effect on student learning. As such, university teachers are not being encouraged to change their traditional pedagogical practices. This manuscript proposes a rather simple method, which draws on but is not directly equivalent to the inverted classroom model. The aim here is to reverse the traditional pedagogical sequence of "Lectures; Tutorials; then Practical work". This mode of teaching is still very popular in the university system, particularly in France. More precisely, in the proposed model, teaching begins with practical work, followed by tutorials and finishing with lectures that offer time for questions and debates. This method places much more importance on collaborative working and the consolidation of students' knowledge and skills. An online course platform called Celene has been widely used to support student learning and to maximize teacher-learner interactions. The proposed approach was tested with students of an electrical engineering course in their final year of engineering school. A full six-year feedback period is discussed to demonstrate the interactivity and effectiveness of the approach. The results of the various experiments carried out show that this method "smooths" out some of the difference in student competence. In particular, it is a powerful remediation approach to restore energy to students, who sometimes feel overwhelmed by the traditional approach, which is very transmissive. As a result, the proposed method significantly reduces failure rates. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Designed for juniors and seniors who are non-engineering majors, my course aimed to get them to think beyond the simple answers they have become accustomed to in many of their introductory math and science classes. I hoped to convey to them the benefits of divergent thinking and reassure them that their unique perspectives would benefit them in solving real-world problems. While perhaps antithetical to the design of many engineering classes, where we want students to master the most effective and efficient way to get the correct answers, my end-of-course feedback has reassured me that my students believe they have improved their ability to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate-the higher levels of mental abstraction described in Bloom's taxonomy that teachers want for all students. While this technique is not without its risks-namely ceding control of class, diverting time from new material, and possibly exposing students to embarrassment-I provide recommendations to compensate for such drawbacks. My intent is to encourage instructors in STEM-related disciplines to encourage student creativity in their classrooms so that they become better problem-solvers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Automation is changing the definition and allocation of jobs in most engineering fields including civil engineering. This digital disruption of civil and environmental engineering (CEE) could potentially result in the extinction of the traditional role of structural engineers. In response, educators must strive to provide students with an evolving skill set, nurturing their creativity and engineering judgment. Students will have to design resilient and sustainable solutions for the built environment in a dynamic, virtually connected setting where clients, architects, and contractors are stakeholders with shrinking budgets but public safety remains paramount. This requires a paradigm shift, not only in the methods of teaching or the equipment used, but actually, in the way the students interact and employ such tools and how they swiftly adapt with a dynamically changing set of objectives. The paper is presenting a case study aiming to improve the civil engineering design process through running a mock classroom experience. This class is mimicking the introduction to engineering design (IED) course, offered at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's School of Engineering (SOE), taught to undergraduate students mentored by senior undergraduate teaching assistants, and supervised by civil engineering professors. The educational module experimented through the mock class proved to revolutionize the way CEE students are introduced to the design process, by radically changing the design methodology and the classroom technology, with respect to the general SoE IED. The new CEE IED offered students the opportunity to brainstorm their designs through cloud-based modeling software, hold client-contractor interactive meetings through a flipped classroom setting, hold prototype analysis and shape optimization meetings through both cloud-based meetings and classroom team discussions, 3D print prototypes, and mechanically test these prototypes. Direct feedback and exit surveys showed that the participating students were able to put in practice what they have learned in their introduction to civil and environmental engineering courses. The current version of the course will help future CEE students to apply the skills that they have learned from CEE introductory courses taught in the semesters prior into IED class. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In most undergraduate civil engineering degree programs, students start with a mechanics sequence in which physics concepts are applied to solve problems. In geotechnical courses, sometimes these physics-based concepts are de-emphasized in favor of focusing on empirical procedures used in practice. While such an approach certainly has its benefits, it can be argued that a well-founded background in fundamental principles can better equip geotechnical engineers to troubleshoot problems and extrapolate to achieving more innovative, resilient, and comprehensive solutions, in particular amidst the rapid rate of technological advance in other fields of science and engineering. Herein, the flipped classroom technique is proposed as one means to promote enhanced student learning of underlying scientific principles in geotechnical engineering. In the flipped classroom, students watch a short video "lecture" outside of class, availing time in class for group problem solving, instructor interaction, and anchoring of solution methods back to fundamentals. Two example applications are presented. Several positive outcomes have been observed: students demonstrate higher command of knowledge and are more interactive, engaged, and enthusiastic about geotechnical engineering. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Traditional university teaching methods are grounded in the delivery of content via passive, didactic lectures that are largely seen as an efficient but not necessarily effective means of mass information transfer. Higher-order, deeper-thinking activities and the application of concepts are reserved for the domain of small classes such as tutorials. The “flipped-classroom” approach shifts the role of the lecture away from basic knowledge transfer to a facilitated, more participatory problem-solving environment. Basic knowledge is transferred via creation of online learning modules utilising short, focused videos. Moving lectures to such a mode of delivery shifts the onus of learning basic material to students, allowing them a level of independence to take ownership of their own learning. Teacher-student interaction in lectures is potentially increased under such a situation and provides ample opportunities for active learning activities. This paper presents a structured approach to transitioning a third-year engineering subject with 150 students from a traditional lecture format to a partially-flipped classroom, adapting research-based templates from the five phase ADDIE model - Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation. The first four phases are described in detail as applied to the subject, including analyses of the subject and learning environment, design and development of learning materials, and implementation of the platform for delivery of video lectures and feedback. The final phase refers to the experimental set up and evaluation of results, where the authors assessed resource-effectiveness and measured students' confidence, engagement, satisfaction and video preferences in order to determine the efficacy of their approach. . © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Particular attention is paid to identifying features of the University 4.0., a promising model of universities that combines physical and virtual space, developing on digital platforms. The authors conclude that at the present stage of development of society there are obvious trends in the development of universities and higher education, including a change in the status of universities due to increased risks in science and experimentation, the transition from competition to partnership interaction, access to large databases (Big Data), the transition to multi-format open educational resources (Open Online Resources), a combination of new and traditional training formats, redevelopment of classrooms in the format of open space (Open Space Education). Obviously, such technologies as mobile training (Bring Your Own Devices), transition to the “inverted classes” (Flipped Classroom), the creation of “wearable” technologies like Google Glass, the development of adaptive learning through the introduction of digital platforms and the spread of the Internet of things will be widespread in the nearest future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom technique has been applied to a part (“Strength of Materials”) of a second-year compulsory course called “Technology of Materials.” Due to the number of students, the course is divided into two groups – one taught with the traditional methodology (98 students), and the other taught with the flipped one (97 students). In the traditional methodology, the teacher explains the lesson and solves the problems, with students as passive actors in the learning process. In the developed flipped classroom model, the students have edited videos on an institutional online platform, available before each face-to-face session. In addition, a linked activity is used to check the students’ knowledge before class. The in-class time is dedicated to briefly reviewing the concepts explained in the video, with a special emphasis on the errors detected in the link activity, followed by groups of students solving problems. The aim of this study is to present quantitative results of the effect of the flipped classroom in engineering with a focus on the gender of the students. The results show that the flipped classroom model has a direct impact on student grades, especially for female students, which presents significant differences when compared with males of the same group. In addition, the grade standard deviation values were lower, ensuring a better general level. The students of the flipped classroom group also attended the exams in a higher ratio than others, as these students are likely to feel more confident in the knowledge they have acquired. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As use of adaptive learning technology in STEM courses gains traction, studies evaluating its impacts are important to undertake. Adaptive e-learning platforms provide personalized, flexible learning via monitoring of student progress and performance and subsequent provision of an individualized learning path containing various resources. In this study, adaptive technology was utilized in blended and flipped versions of a numerical methods course. A particular challenge with flipped instruction is preclass preparation, in which videos with the same instruction for all students are often assigned. Therefore, to diversify preclass learning, the instructor developed adaptive lessons via an NSF grant and rigorously assessed outcomes in this flipped class with adaptive learning. In addition, to fully evaluate the lessons and respond to calls from the literature, the lessons were implemented and evaluated in a blended version of the course, which was lecture-based with available online resources. Data from previous semesters of flipped and blended instruction (without adaptive learning were available), enabling a comparison of four instructional methods. The comparisons consisted of direct assessment (i.e., exam questions) and affective assessment via a survey (i.e., perceptions of the classroom environment). An analysis was performed for students collectively and for underrepresented minority students in engineering. Focus groups enabled a comparison of student perspectives of using adaptive technology in blended versus flipped classrooms as well as by demographic. Upon combining these outcomes, including a notable Cohen's d = 0.34 for open-ended-response performance, the flipped classroom with adaptive learning may be the best method for this STEM course. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The pre-class work (usually videos) teaches the material that originally would have been covered in lectures, so that a portion of student study time occurs before class. The in-class session involves the application of content and is accomplished through collaborative problem-solving activities, peer-to-peer teaching, and the student questions. Post-class work consists of additional homework problems. The FC provides students with more control in their studying, promotes student-centered and higher-order learning, and enables deeper discussion of the material. However, FC requires significant work on the front-end for both professor and students and does not work well for students who are in class all day. The end goal of higher education is for students to be problem-solvers, and as such, the FC is an excellent teaching method to this end. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We implemented a CURE within a senior-level biofluid mechanics course that was primarily taught using a flipped classroom approach. Due to the large class size, the students analyzed data that was publicly available and produced by one of our laboratories. Student teams then developed hypotheses based on the data analysis and designed a set of in vitro and in vivo experiments to test those hypotheses. The hypotheses and experiments that were most highly rated by the class were then tested in our laboratory. At the end of the class, student gains were assessed by self-report and compared to those self-reported by students engaging in a traditional freshman undergraduate summer research experience. While the students in the CURE reported moderate gains in self-assessment of research-based skills, their selfreported gains were statistically significantly lower than those reported by students who participated in the traditional research experience. We believe that the CURE could be improved through implementation in a lower level class, enabling students to observe laboratory experiments, and providing additional feedback throughout the hypothesis development and experimental design process. Overall, the CURE is an innovative way to expand research experiences, in particular for engineering students who often do not participate in hypothesis-driven research during their undergraduate education. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The lessons are learned outside the classroom, and in this methodology of learning, the 'task' is done collaboratively. Students receive the theoretical content of the subjects outside of the classroom by viewing videos usually designed by the teacher; the advantage is that fewer class hours permit the teachers to design more meaningful activities and delve deeper into the course contents [1]. This research was carried out among students who were studying the subject of Mathematics II in the engineering curricula at the Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Santa Fe. Two groups were formed, one experimental and the other a control group. The inverted classroom strategy was used throughout the semester for the experimental group, and the classes were taught in a traditional way to the control group. In this work, we present some analyses with which we determined whether there was a statistically significant difference in student performance between the two groups, and we analyzed whether the use of the inverted classroom improved student attitudes towards the teaching/learning process compared to the control group receiving the traditional methodology. In the inverted classroom, directed videos were used as a technological strategy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Lacking student preparation before class has been the most commonly identified challenge when adopting the flipped classroom approach. In this study, we have introduced a class activity which can increase student pre-class online engagement and help them better prepare for the in-class activity. During this activity, students are required to work in small groups before in-class activities to answer open-ended questions related to the course learning materials via an online shared document. Based on teachers' duty, there are four stages for implementation of the proposed activity which are: (1) initiation: teacher needs to design open-ended questions and creates online shared editable documents for each group; (2) scaffolding: teacher assists learners in providing responses by checking their editing logs; (3) assessment: students' access to the online shared documents will be suspended and teacher will evaluate students responses; and (4) reflection: teacher will address common issues and propose more challenging questions before the related in-class activities. We have conducted experiments in the third cohort of a flipped general education course on computational thinking and algorithms. Except for the proposed class activity, the first two cohorts of this course have the same design and content in three topics and therefore worked as control groups. Online interaction data of all three cohorts have been collected for a thorough comparison. Results showed that students' average lecture video access rates have improved in the third cohort compared to the first two cohorts by 49 % and 39 % respectively. The percentage of students who never accessed any lecture videos decreased from around 29 % in the first and second cohorts to 6 % in the third cohort where the proposed activity was implemented. A statistically significant difference was discovered between the first and third cohorts (t = -15.06, p<0.00001), and between the second and third cohorts (t = _27.02, p<0.00001) of the course in lecture video access rates. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we present an experience report about using FC and TBL in a CS1 course. We present the motivation for restructuring the course, the specific implementation, the results of two student surveys, and the outcome of several exams. We discuss the results, present what actions were taken during the course period, and what changes will be carried out in the future. The results from the surveys show that 47% of the students were pleased with the organization of the course, whereas up to 33% of the students were displeased (in particular the female students). About 60% of the students liked the TBL in class, but about half of the students felt that the course lacked traditional lecturing. Finally, it was surprising that 44% of the students never or seldom read the textbook before class, while 74% watched the videos. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The research design employed in this study is a single group, pre-Test, post-Test analysis. The main research problem being addressed in this study is does the flipped contents when integrated with LCM based structured learning activities lead to an improved engagement of students, thereby increasing the conceptual understanding. First, the students were primed for one full semester to get adapted with the flipped classroom method as well as the LCM activity formats. Further, few key interventions were prompted such as giving incentives, grouping, counselling of low engaged and performers, support materials, NPTel based resources, etc across the first few modules, with an aim to improve the out-of-class engagement. Our results showed that the engagement and learning effectiveness showed considerable improvement upon priming following the key interventions. Further, the students showed positive perception of learning, engagement and usefulness towards this blended technique. Few recommendations are provided for the other teachers who would like to adopt the contextualize improvisation of the LCM model for their flipped teaching-learning practices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Today, learning is perceived as a challenge that must be faced simultaneously on numerous fronts. Indeed, learning is no longer confined to the classroom. Students have the opportunity to learn inside and outside the classroom walls. Technology plays its part, as does the abundance of information available on social networks and in the mass media. Educators must stay abreast of change as information and potentially useful technological resources leave traditional education behind. Optimising class time through new methods, techniques and resources is paramount in today’s education systems. This paper presents the results of a quantitative study of students’ written production in English. The English writing skills of engineering students were developed using situational (or class) simulations and a large-scale web-based simulation in real time. Quantitative analysis of students’ written production was used to test for differences between experimental and control groups. The goal of this study was to show that simulation-based instruction contributes significantly to students’ progress in written production in English. The results showed that students who received simulation-based instruction (experimental group) significantly improved their English writing skills, primarily in terms of organisation and linking of ideas more than students who attended a regular English course (control group). © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flipped classes are well-known for reversing the typical in-class lecture and out-of-class homework structure by instructing students to learn by themselves from on-line learning materials and inviting them to ask questions based on their individual difficulties in class. Many attempts at integrating this teaching method into English as a foreign language (EFL) classrooms have proven to be beneficial to students’ learning achievement and motivation. However, there is little research on how to organize interactive, engaging and effective in-class activities for an EFL flipped classroom. In this study, a student response system (SRS) is proposed to support teachers in organizing in-class activities in a flipped class. To investigate the effectiveness of this approach, a quasi-experiment was conducted in an EFL classroom in an engineering school. The experimental group used the SRS to do in-class activities while the control group followed the conventional method. The results showed that the use of the SRS increased students’ learning motivation and self-efficacy in learning English grammar and improved their participation and engagement in the in-class activities of the flipped learning process. Furthermore, the questionnaire results showed that students accepted the SRS as an instructional method in an EFL flipped class. However, the use of the SRS was not effective in improving students’ grammar learning achievement. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Contribution: This paper has demonstrated that the use of blended learning in an electrical machines course has increased student engagement, pass rate, and scores across the GPA spectrum. Background: Lack of engagement by students in electric machine courses have been reported across the world. Interventions however, usually take the form of laboratory and simulation assignments. There is little information on, however, the use of blended learning and flipped classroom techniques to combat these problems. Intended Outcomes: Increased engagement in the course evidenced by exam performance. In particular, for the transformer, dc motor, induction motor, and synchronous motor the students should be able to explain the construction and principle of operation, and compute voltages, currents and power for various operating conditions. Application Design: The approach involved online lectures, tutorial submissions, and peer feedback forums followed by face to face tutorial sessions. These were chosen because online activities would allow students to access material on devices with which they are accustomed to engaging deeply and because peer feedback has been shown to build community, and increase the quality of discourse for both students and lecturer. Findings: There was a significant improvement in exam performance when compared to previous years. The pass rate of the course moved from approximately 60% in previous years to 86%. The class average mark also increased from approximately 50% in previous years to 63%. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Computer science programs have been delivering newly undergraduate students to the software industry without sufficient knowledge on how to perform software testing activities. It occurs because that activity is usually taught as part of Software Engineering courses, which means that teachers have to put a lot of efforts to teach the main testing techniques and criteria along with many other contents. In this way, the content is mostly addressed in a theoretical way as the teacher has to stick to the course schedule and has no time to address the testing practice. On the other hand, some studies reported the efforts of professors to optimize the time during classes and attract students to the software testing area. These efforts are associated with the employment of activities in which students are actively engaged in the classroom, solving problems, developing real projects, or dealing with real cases. A pedagogical model that seeks to leverage such an approach is the flipped classroom model. However, while some have praised that model, others have criticized it. In the state of the art, there is no consensus about the appropriateness of flipped classroom for specific learning contents. In this paper, we present an experimental study that was conducted to verify the suitability of the flipped classroom model to teach software testing, especially black-box testing. This study comprised an analysis of students’ learning gains when subject to the flipped model and the workload introduced when compared to the traditional teaching model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, we observed that many students are less up-to-date than in traditional courses. To counter this problem, we have developed a learning management system (LMS) with unique features oriented for “flipped courses”. The new LMS allows students to watch videos, to interact with Jupyter Notebooks and to complete the exercises directly on the website. The LMS automatically creates progression graphics for each student and pushes automatic messages related to their progression. For instructors, the LMS automatically creates statistics about the overall class progression throughout the lessons and exercises and allows targeting students in difficulty whose can then be individually helped. The LMS was introduced in several engineering courses and helped to lower the failure rate. With machine learning algorithms, the LMS can also demonstrate the importance to keep the students continuously up-to-date in a course. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In first-year engineering students, a common teacher-centred, passive learning and deficient secondary educational backgrounds are often observed. However, there is a problematic difference whether the individual background is vocational education and training (VAT) or baccalaureate. This implies an educational need to level up these backgrounds, together with a more student-centred, active learning. As a possible practical remedy, an approach of independent learning before the class was implemented, as in a flipped classroom. To this end, students were requested to study the topic scheduled for the next class independently as an out-of-class activity or ‘homework’, by using sources suggested (handbooks and web pages). At first, this task was not monitored. In a second phase, the task was monitored by a handwritten summary delivered before the class. A questionnaire survey showed that this type of homework was perceived as fostering a better understanding of theory in class and a more appealing class, but only if it was controlled as described. In addition, some differences surfaced depending on a student’s educational background (VAT vs. baccalaureate), but also in repeaters vs. non-repeaters. A quantitative comparison of final-exam marks and homework marks reveals a better performance by most students with sufficient homework, although with some limitations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This full paper in the research to practice category reports an effort to investigate the impact of instructional methods on the student performance in a flipped classroom. Flipped classroom is a pedagogical approach that has received a significant research attention in recent times. Yet, current studies have not explored the effect of instructional methods, made available by internet and multimedia technologies, on students' performance in flipped classroom. This creates a gap in both the knowledge and practice of flipped classroom. In our effort to fill this gap and contribute to knowledge, we designed an exploratory study to investigate how each of the five instructional methods used in engineering education affect students' performance in a flipped classroom. Accordingly, we registered 35 students into an Information Systems (IS) core course and divided them into two classes (identified using their section codes, 01 and 1E) taught by the same professor. Class 01 (the experimental group) was taught with a flipped model while Class 1E (the control group) was taught with the traditional model. Data was collected from two sources, students' grades and questionnaire responses. After analyzing the data, we made some findings that would be useful to professors practicing flipped classroom. We summarize the key findings as follows: (a) Instructional methods that are interactive, interdependent and peer-focused are most preferred by students and offer greater learning experience. (b) Students who indicated Connect Interactive as their most preferred instructional method, in flipped classroom, performed better than their peers by a range of 25%. We consider this study to be exploratory in nature because of its relatively small sample size. Yet, we provide discussions, analysis and recommendations that can inform the practice of flipped pedagogy. It also provides a foundation for further research on the relationship between instructional methods and student performance in flipped classroom. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It was designed for a class of open and distance education for adult students taking a modern educational technology course at a learning center. Unlike FCLM, The OFCLM made use of network live broadcast and multi-screens synchronous interaction technology instead of the face-to-face classroom to realize an online flipping classroom. The study focused on the perceptions and experiences the students in regard to the design and implementation of the OFCLM. The main findings indicated that the students liked the flexibility and convenience of the online flipped classroom learning model. The study found that paying attention to the online students' discussion, a teaching assistant, group cooperation, the participation of online adult students, the redesign of instructional activities like online in-class flipped teaching mode, and the quality of audio were critical to the effectiveness of the OFCLM. It is found that adult learners' higher-order knowledge construction was improved through online discussion and group activity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flipped classroom is an instructional model in which basic subject matter knowledge is learned prior to in-class sessions, and active learning experiences happen in class. To address a gap in recent research regarding students' pre-class learning design and its effect in flipped classrooms, an experimental study was conducted to investigate pre-service teachers' pre-class learning effects in a flipped classroom course. The control group completed their pre-class learning by viewing ordinary videos. Treatment group I completed their pre-class learning by viewing interactive videos with pop-up questions based upon the Knowledge Integration theory. Treatment group II completed questions which were based upon the Knowledge Integration theory on discussion boards before and after viewing the videos. All three groups had the same instructor, classroom learning activities, and learning evaluation approaches. This study found that the learning achievement and self-efficacy of the learners in the two treatment groups were significantly higher than those in the control group. In addition, the pre-class learning experience designed by the Knowledge Integration theory was well received by the learners in the flipped classroom. The pre-service teachers in the two treatment groups also indicated that these pre-class learning experiences could better promote the relationship between their learning and their subject teaching work in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The flipped classroom has become more widely used in engineering education. However, a systematic and quantitative assessment of its achievement outcomes has not been conducted to date. Purpose: To address this gap, we examined the findings from comparative articles published between 2008 and 2017 through a meta-analysis to summarize the overall effects of the flipped classroom on student achievement in engineering education. Scope/Method: We searched and analyzed journal and conference publications on flipped classroom studies in engineering education in K-12 and higher education contexts. Twenty-nine comparative interventions were included in a meta-analysis involving 2,590 students exposed to flipped classroom and 2,739 students exposed to traditional lectures. A content analysis was also conducted to determine how the flipped engineering classroom benefits student learning. Conclusions: The meta-analysis comparing these 29 traditional—flipped interventions in relation to student achievement showed an overall significant effect in favor of the flipped classroom over traditional lecturing (Hedges' g = 0.289, 95% CI [0.165, 0.414], p <.001). A moderator analysis showed that the effect of the flipped classroom was further enhanced when instructors offered a brief review at the start of face-to-face classes. Our qualitative findings suggest that self-paced learning and more problem-solving activities were the two most frequently reported benefits that promoted student learning. Based on quantitative and qualitative support, several implications are identified for future practice, such as offering a brief in-class review of preclass materials. Some recommendations for future research are also provided. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Process control is a relatively young field, with commercial PID-type controllers developed largely in the 1930′s. Initial publications were applications-focused and authored primarily by instrumentation and control vendors. While some chemical engineering departments had instrumentation and control courses by the 1940′s, process control textbooks with a theoretical basis did not appear until the mid-1950′s, yet by 1950 there was already a concern about a theory vs. practice “gap.” Evolving views on this gap are discussed, and course content, delivery and textbooks used during the past 75 years are reviewed. The focus then turns to a flipped classroom, where students view screencasts, read textbook material and take an on-line quiz before class, which has been implemented in a process dynamics and control course. The class periods involve brief lectures summarizing what they have studied, and include discussions and advanced problem solving using MATLAB and Simulink. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flipped Classroom (FC) is a blended learning approach being promoted in higher education in recent years. It flips the conventional pedagogic arrangement so that students use the out-of-class time to conduct lower-order learning and the in-class time to conduct higher-order learning. Nevertheless, unlike the adoption phenomena in other academic disciplines such as Science, Engineering, Medicine and Education in university teaching, the adoption of FC in Social Science has been rare. This paper reports on a quantitative study (n = 152) in which the Stages of Concern model was employed to probe into the concerns of Social Science faculty members (SSFMs) about introducing FC into their teaching practice. The study reveals that the participants were having strong categorical concerns of “Information” and “Management.” The findings shed light on designing more precise interventions for addressing SSFMs’ actual needs when flipping their classrooms, providing a useful reference for researchers and practitioners who are pursuing work on promoting FC in higher education. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This ranges from non-acceptance of any new format of teaching, unwillingness to put in extra effort, inhibition stemming from the perception of their peers. To that end the teaching method and assessment were developed that included constructivism, social constructivism and problem-based learning as pedagogy. The programme designed also integrated flipped learning, peer and self-reviews, consistent marking structures based on the Vygotsky Activity Theory. The results confirm initial and strong resistance towards the methodology, lack of physical, emotional and mental input, initial fear and shyness towards the perception of others.

Factors that are considered for research include but not limited to the following, culture on campus, teaching and learning models, and student experience in classroom, gender bias, and stereotypes. One of the major factors is the teaching model adopted which have impact on the student learning styles and their experience in the classroom. Teaching models include traditional models, modern flipped class-room models, and active learning approaches. This study focuses on active learning approaches and their impact on students learning and experience. Light-weight team is an active learning approach, in which team members have little direct impact on each other‟s final grades, with significant long-term socialization. In this work we used data from end of course student evaluation.

The students were divided into two groups: an experimental flipped classroom group and a control group. Experimental group was taught via flipped classroom, while the control group taught via traditional strategy. The levels of self-regulation and social connectedness were measured through questionnaire at the beginning and the end of the classes. The results based on ANOVA analysis reported that students in flipped classroom had shown significantly higher level of self-regulation and social connectedness compared to students in the traditional group. Based on the obtained findings, self-regulated learning and social connectedness were successful in making significant improvements among students exposed to flipped classroom mode compared to their counterparts in the traditional group.

In higher education, gamification is a methodology intending to motivate students to acquire academical knowledge and soft skills, while keeping them engaged and pleased with the learning process. This study reports the application of a gamified class concerning electric resistors, the first of a 12-topic discipline offered to 2nd-year students in physics and engineering. Adopting a Flipped Classroom methodology and a narrative based on household power consumption, traditional contents about resistors and electricity were taught. Also, instructions about how to use an ohm-meter and how to configure an electronic spreadsheet to do basic statistics were given. In order to customize and enrich the class, some optional contents (usually in a video) were made available. The access to the experimental activities was constrained by approval in four graded quizzes. Every activity was acknowledged by virtual coins to be converted in benefits (extra time to run final examinations, permission to consult class appointments and the opportunity to re-discuss a mistake in the final examination) and points, to rank students (leaderboard). Forty-five students attended the gamified class. No control group was implemented because this study aimed to find a good design for a gamified class, not to compare traditional to active methodologies. The overall student acceptance was excellent, and they reported that gamification can be a more engaging methodology than traditional classes, further developing soft skills and academic knowledge. However, the time spent to run the gamified class must be arranged, reducing the time inside the classroom. The opportunity to perform the experiment was considered essential, and could not be substituted by videos or texts since new doubts and concerns are pointed out during the practice when the teacher is present. Gamification can be a methodology capable of engaging and being enjoyable students, giving them more than just information but also soft skills. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Applications and outcomes of a flipped classroom in an engineering setting continue to be limited despite recognized advantages including positive gains in problem-solving skills, conceptual understanding, student retention, and student satisfaction. This paper focuses on the implementation of a flipped classroom for an undergraduate biomedical engineering introductory biomechanics course. To flip the classroom, content videos were created by teaching assistants (TAs) to provide a fist exposure to content material. Students were asked to watch videos prior to coming to class while in-class time was dedicated to practice and feedback via problem solving. With content disseminated in videos, valuable in-class time was spent utilizing team-based learning to solve problems in small groups of two to four based on self-selected seating arrangements. A unique aspect of this course was the amount of input, participation, and leadership provided by a team of four graduate student TAs. With the guidance of an experienced faculty member, TAs recorded video lectures, prepared and led in-class and lab-based sessions, and created online homework assessments that could be automatically graded by the online course management system. Successful implementation of a flipped classroom model was achieved and although challenges were encountered, the success of the course was based on course evaluations, student and teaching assistant feedback, and improvements in biomechanics related knowledge as assessed by concept inventory assessments. Knowledge acquisition over the course of the semester was demonstrated by a 38% gain score demonstrating increased knowledge using the Biomechanics Concept Inventory Version 3. Although students reported mixed feedback for instructors and the course as a whole, primarily positive feedback was provided for the evaluation of the TAs participation in this course. Increased participation from TAs provided benefits including: improved participation and communication from students, appropriate integration of course content in regards to prerequisite knowledge and subsequent course follow-up, and efficient use of technology and online course management. In addition, TAs benefited immensely from added responsibilities including increasing their in-depth knowledge in the field of biomechanics and improving their teaching skills applicable to their future careers. The purpose of this paper was to discuss the effectiveness of a flipped course model for both undergraduate students and graduate student instructors. The results may serve as a guide to encourage engineering educators to implement a flipped classroom for the benefit of all, including undergraduate students, graduate students, and the instructor of record. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Engineering courses can be divided into two categories: theory-intensive and practice-intensive courses. For the courses in the second category, students cannot learn the knowledge and skills effectively without doing homework assignments. However, because the solution manuals are widely available, and many students take this shortcut approach. In order to prevent students screwing up, a pilot hole approach can be adopted. After a homework is assigned, a portion of class time is used for students to work on these problems in small groups. During this short practice session, students can figure out the ways to solve the problems through discussions. This practice session serves just like a pilot hole in carpentry, which can provide the guidance for the screws. Compared with the approach of a fully-flipped classroom, this partially-flipped approach can strike a balance between teaching and practice. In general, 60-80% of class time is used for teaching, and 20-40% of class time is reserved for the practice sessions. In this way, it does not undermine the lecture component significantly. At the end of the semester, students completed a survey on this approach, and the result was quite encouraging. In addition, from the messages left in the course evaluation at the end of the semester, students revealed that working on the homework problems was very helpful for them to understand the concepts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As more technologies are used in high educational institutions, many universities are exploring the flipped classroom methodology. The College of Engineering at Texas A&M University is investing heavily in new technologies in education. A new engineering building was recently completed with classrooms equipped with new technologies that are designed for active learning. The engineering technology programs are taking steps to develop courses that use the flipped classroom approach. While there are many successful implementations of the flipped classroom approach, there are also failed attempts. To successfully implement the flipped classroom approach, each course must be carefully revised to convert to this new pedagogy. This paper discusses the work-in-progress effort of flipping a course in an engineering technology program. It is expected that the target course will be flipped over the period of two years. Each semester, a small portion of the course material will be flipped. Feedback from students is collected throughout the two-year period. Evaluations of effectiveness of the flipped classroom will be carried out. Based on the feedback and evaluations, appropriate changes will be made. In the Fall semester of 2018, three lectures were flipped. Videos and other online materials were made for these lectures. Lectures notes, homework assignments, and laboratory materials were developed to support the flipped classroom effort. Virtual help sessions on eCampus using Blackboard Collaborate Ultra were created to help students learn the material. Based on the results in the two-year period, it will be determined how much of the lectures will be flipped. Challenges and lessons learned during the first semester are discussed, these include: What if students do not spend time prepare for the flipped class? What if it takes longer time to cover the materials using the flipped classroom approach? Is there an impact on the faculty teaching load or the actual time they spend in teaching the course? While many of these questions have been answered in the literature, it is important to realize that each university, college, program, and course is different from others. This paper will provide another case study for flipped classroom that other educators can benefit from. Both positive experience and lessons learned from this effort will be included in the presentation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This project is a combined effort from three universities: San José State University (SJSU), California State University-Los Angeles (CSULA), and Cal Poly Pomona (CPP). This project aims to improve retention rates in STEM courses thereby increasing the number of students who graduate with STEM degrees. The three universities belong to the CSU system which is the largest university system in the entire country.

The results show the students who attended the flipped session had marginally better projects according to the scoring rubric used, but nothing significant. Reasons for the lack of anything conclusive might be due to how the metric was used in the experiment and student motivation. Further study is needed to develop a more in-depth experiment. Future work include repeating the study, but providing more incentives to motivate the students. Incentives could include a competition for best projects. Our current plan is to offer extra credit toward the final grade if students add more components, increase complexity in their circuitry, or focus on writing their own code. When the students were surveyed, 79% of the students say they enjoyed the instructional methods used in the course and 82% of the students were engaged by the instructional methods used. Overall, the survey response overwhelmingly shows that students like the addition of the Arduino tutorials and find them to be useful.

	abstract = {Flipped classrooms with different forms of implementation are now popular in engineering programs. Instructors use the flipped model to focus on learning activities in the classroom, application of theoretical concepts, and students have to gain understanding on the concepts from videos or other instructional material prior to class. Thus far, the research on this pedagogy focused largely on students' perspective of this type of classroom and inquiry has been done on its effectiveness over the traditional lecture. The purpose of this study is to gauge students' understanding of the concepts presented in the video they are supposed to watch prior to class. Students enrolled in three sections of “Introduction to Fluid Mechanics” participated in this study. To test the impact of review before quizzes on student performance, a quasi-experimental study with three conditions for test-taking was used: a) with brief review of notes before the quiz b) with brief reflection on videos before the quiz c) no review/reflection before quiz. In each condition, students took a three-minute, one-word quiz. By being provided only one word as a prompt, student learning is aided because students are required to recall, rather than identify, pertinent information through identification of the context of the word and explain the concept in their own words. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background Conventional undergraduate circuits and electronics laboratory courses are traditionally taught within the “brick and mortar” walls of a college or university where students are seated at lab benches outfitted with a standard test equipment, including a power supply, multimeter, function generator, and oscilloscope. As enrollment increases, additional laboratory sections or new laboratories need to be constructed; both costly to the school. This research study evaluated a hybrid model to educate more students without impacting learning or increasing cost. Purpose This paper documents a new approach, called the “hybrid laboratory,” developed and tested based on the research question “What is the effect on student learning when traditional laboratory teaching is modified and augmented with a student owned computer-driven laboratory tool?” Method The study design was a quasi-experimental mixed-methods with treatment and control groups (η = 200). Over three semesters, information collected identified the impact on learning when conventional laboratory practices are combined with learning outside of the laboratory spaces utilizing one of the many tools available, the Analog Discovery. Results Data revealed that the new approach improved the final course grade average by the treatment group by 2%, indicating improved learning and no negative impact to the students. Results also indicate that laboratory learner was equal to and exceeded that of a traditional style laboratory offering, student laboratory report grades, and laboratory proficiency grades were also higher. The study revealed that students enrolled in the non-traditional laboratory sections had better in laboratory attendance than those in the traditional sections. Conclusion Comparison of tradition laboratory learning to a hybrid laboratory revealed that laboratory learning increased when utilizing the hybrid approach without adding additional cost to the students or school. Based on this study, the university will evaluate extending this pedagogy to additional laboratory classes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The EM-PSI is a student's self-assessment of their problem solving and critical thinking abilities broken down into three sub-categories, 1) problem solving confidence, 2) approach-avoidance style, and 3) personal control. The EM-PSI is an innovative tool that is eventually intended be used as an evaluation metric, together with traditional metrics such as GPA and test scores, to improve pedagogical techniques and curricular content. The EM-PSI was evaluated in a pilot study by distributing a 30 question survey to undergraduate civil engineering students and engineering faculty at Washington State University in the Fall 2017 and Spring 2018. The survey was voluntary and there was a total of 73 responses in the target groups. Internal consistency of the EM-PSI items was evaluated using Cronback's alpha for each sub-category and it was determined that each has acceptable reliable. Initial results for an ANOVA analysis are also presented. The initial statistical results show that EM-PSI is statistically significant between undergraduate students and engineering faculty. Post-hoc analysis that will be conducted in the future will determine if class year, gender, type of high-school education, and/or parents being engineers has any significant effect on EM-PSI score. Future research hopes to demonstrate that the EM-PSI is reliable, consistent, and a good predictor of technical problem solving. EM-PSI scores will provide educators with another tool to track the effects of pedagogical changes (i.e. flipped classroom, problem-based learning modules, etc.) and curricular changes on student self-assessment of their critical thinking and problem solving ability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study presents a data science methodology to integrate and explore disparate student data from an engineering-mathematics course. Our methodology is based on exploratory data mining and visualization for analyzing and visualizing raw student data from multiple data sources. The exploratory analysis serves two purposes, 1) it supports the instructor's desire to gain insights into the implementation of a flipped classroom and 2) it serves as a case study for a proposed data science pipeline for educational data. As part of the flipped class, the instructor had students completed assignments in an online homework system before each class meeting and work readiness assessment tests (RATs) at the beginning of each class. The RAT scores were recorded in excel and combined with student performance data that was exported from the online homework system. Paper exams were administered at the end of each unit, and combined with RAT scores, lesson assignment scores, and demographic data. A combination of data mining and classical statistical techniques were used to reveal the trends and peculiarities in the data, without having a specific question or topic to investigate. The data science pipeline which we present has four major stages: data preprocessing, exploratory factor analysis, visualization, and feature engineering. Our study revealed some trends and clusters within and across course units. Analysis results show the differences and similarities within the course units and help track learner behavior. A few differences related to gender were found, but prior experience in a course taught using the flipped classroom model did not show a significant difference. Exploratory factor analysis identified two factors from the whole data: class activities and exams (factor 1) and homeworks and lesson assignments (factor 2). The discovered factors were found to cluster in two groups within the course units: Unit 1 to 7 and Unit 8 to 13, which has a dividing point at the withdraw date. Results also showed that female students had more class activity scores (i.e. they attended and participated in more classes) than male students. Future work will include collecting more data and generating hypotheses that can be tested using collected data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flipping the class means changing the traditional style of teaching (via lectures) to facilitate self-learning through engaging the students. The students' attention span is as short as 15 minutes; hence, the traditional lecturing does not promote effective learning. Sometimes, flipped class looks chaos when 50 or more students interact with each other to try to solve engineering problems to arrive at the right solution. Nevertheless, at the end of the class period, the number of students that learn the subject precisely improves a lot. Recently, flipping the classes has been used widely in all kinds of classrooms across the globe, whether it is K-12 educational institution or post-secondary educational establishment. Construction Management is a course that cannot be taught by mere lectures only. It has a lot of definitions, principles, theories and hypotheses that need to be taught in 50-minute class setting. Given the fact that the attention span is short for most of the audience, it is difficult to create keen interest among students in the class for the whole 50 minutes' period. Effective teaching is very difficult to incorporate in the classroom. Flipping the class to hands-on activities yields promising results. Hands-on activities can include exercises such as group discussion, Building Code review exercises, Shadowing Construction Managers at construction sites, working through construction management software and working on a mock construction project. This paper explores the different ways of flipping classes and their advantages and disadvantages through different case studies and the personal experiences of flipping classes for the past 20 years of teaching. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Engineering course redesign with educational pedagogy is gaining widespread acceptance. There is a move from teacher-centered lectures to student-centered active learning strategies that will benefit student learning. It is important that students develop critical thinking and analytical skills that will form the basis of lifelong learning. In this regards many educators have developed project-based learning exercises in engineering and other courses so that the students will learn by doing. Project-based learning motivates the learners and provides “hands-on” and “minds-on” training. A laboratory-based civil engineering course in Computer Aided Structural Analysis Design and Experimentation is redesigned using Fink's Taxonomy of significant learning with learning goals and several dimensions from foundational knowledge, application, integration, human dimension, caring and learning how to learn. In this respect, e-Learning plays a critical role in knowledge and skills development as well as course management. Learning Management System Moodle is used as an e-Learning tool for communication with students. The course materials developed include video components of lectures as flipped classes, and electronic clickers to engage students in the classroom, and Moodle LMS as a vehicle for engaging students outside the class through discussion sessions and accessing course materials such as video lectures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Project-based learning in a team setting can be a significant platform in engineering curricula for collaborative learning, engagement and student retention of learned material. While several practices for team formation are evident in literature, a limited number focus on maximizing student satisfaction while working in teams. This is critical for first-year students who just entered college in a competitive admissions process and often require some learning to understand collaboration in a team setting. At Stevens Institute of Technology (Stevens), we have analyzed the freshman team experiences in three-major core engineering courses, and this paper presents example practices that have promoted positive teamwork experiences as well as quality project outcomes. In this study, we used team assessment data from three courses from the same cohort of students (214) across multiple sections in the 2017-2018 academic year; first-semester design course on basic electromechanical systems and robotics in the fall semester, second-semester design course on fielded systems, and the introductory course on entrepreneurial thinking. All courses used project-based learning with teams of three or four students. A software tool and its built-in methodologies (CATME) were used to assess overall satisfaction with their teammates, which we adopted as a measure of student satisfaction from their team experience. Major differential factors in our study included, whether the students were given a project by the instructor or allowed to define their own project; and if they had any choice in selecting their teammates. In the first-semester design course, students were sorted in teams using a hierarchical set of policies defined in CATME's Team-Maker and were assigned a project for the semester; all students in the course worked on the same project. In the second-semester design course, students were able to pick their teammates with a few restrictions, but a project was assigned to them. The students in the entrepreneurial thinking course selected their teammates and their project with the constraint that it must follow a theme of social innovation. While traditionally it is challenging to maintain quality when students define their own project, instructors reviewed the student project proposals and established a level of the quality and scope for the projects. Small class sizes (less than 28 students), flexible teaching methods, standardized evaluation rubrics, and flipped classroom methods are all used to ensure the learning objectives for these courses are consistently met across the sections. Overall group satisfaction was 5% higher in the entrepreneurial thinking course than second-semester design course and 8% higher than that of first-semester design course. We found that prior experience of working in teams enhances the satisfaction score as evident from the increased ratings from first to the second-semester courses. Additionally, when looking at the engineering design courses that had the same subset of instructors, 83% had improved team satisfaction with a 7% average increase in the second course, when compared to the first. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This work-in-progress paper reports on the effects of alternative course design and instructional methods in the engineering classroom. The primary method of delivery in undergraduate engineering classrooms remains the traditional lecture format, or teacher-centered instruction, despite evidence that active learning, or student-centered teaching practices, are significantly more effective. Catalyzed by the overwhelming research support for more active learning methods and the promise for creating these opportunities through alternative course models, there has been a more recent shift towards experimentation in delivery and course structure, including strategies such as flipping course content. Flipped course design allows instructors to maintain delivery of critical theoretical and background information by presenting this material to the students outside of formal classroom time, thus preserving time in-class for more active learning and problem-based activities. The flipped learning course design continues to gain popularity in engineering education; however, large-scale quantitative statistical analysis of student outcomes and achievement in courses taught simultaneously through alternative course designs remains limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of these varied instructional methods by investigating the student achievement outcomes of engineering students enrolled in the same course taught through three different instructional models. The study also aims to assess more specific flipped course design components (video lectures) on student outcomes as well as to evaluate the data through the context of the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) and Constructivist theoretical models. Beginning in the fall of 2018, a 200-level mechanical/aerospace course, Statics, was taught by three different faculty members at a large university in the Southwest. Each of these sections were taught in different ways: (a) traditional lecture format, (b) flipped style classroom, and (c) mixed version, which utilized videos created for the flipped classroom as supplemental material but delivered course content primarily through lecture style. Student-level data were collected for all three of the Statics sections of interest in this study. Data were analyzed to determine if students enrolled in flipped or mixed sections experienced improved achievement outcomes greater than their traditional-lecture peers. Initial data showed that the mixed course design had the greatest impact on student achievement as measured by grade distribution, DEW rates, and student performance on class assignments, quizzes, and exams. The flipped and mixed courses were associated with greater improvement for DEW rates, in comparison to the traditional lecture course. Additional data analysis may provide further insight into how specific flipped delivery components, such as video lectures, impact student achievement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This research paper presents an automated, randomized grading system to support active learning activities and studies its effectiveness in second year (i.e., sophomore-level) engineering programming course. Formative assessment is an essential tool to both the instructor as well as the learner to measure course and concept progression. Further, immediate feedback is known to facilitate student learning, but is not widely adopted. As more classes convert to flipped-style modalities and dedicate significant portions of time to active learning activities, it is important to ensure that students are coming to class prepared. This paper addresses a method to increase opportunities for assessment that includes rapid feedback to the learner. Online quizzes are one example of a method for providing immediate feedback and gauging student preparedness. However, such a system has its own set of limitations. This paper presents a system to generate randomized assessments for each student from a bank of questions that can be quickly graded and returned to students. The system supports automatic grading of multiple-choice questions and tallying open-response questions marked by the instructor. After scanning in the completed assessments, students are emailed their result with the marked and corrected version as a file attachment. To evaluate this system, a second year programming course at a small, undergraduate-only midwestern institution was modified to include brief quizzes on daily readings in order to increase time for in-class assignments. The quizzes were distributed during the first few minutes of each class meeting, and students were typically emailed their results within an hour after the completion of the lecture. This system was also used for the two in-class examinations and final examination. Results from the exams indicate that the group of “lost” students constituting the bottom 10% of the class, were supported and brought into the passing grade range. Results from the final exam show a strong improvement of the mean from 77% to 85%. This paper compares exam performance and student-self evaluations between the courses. A discussion of the system and how it facilitates near-immediate feedback and supports flipped classrooms or specifications-based grading schemes concludes the paper. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

These techniques range from simple to more-involved techniques, and my objectives ranged from increasing interactivity during class to tailoring class time to students' needs and questions. These various techniques include think-share, think-pair-share, observe and comment, group discussion, and the flipped classroom. Active learning has been shown to be more effective than passive learning within a traditional lecture setting. In my courses, these methods have shown increased student understanding of the differences between mathematical models and physical realizations of systems. Adding active learning exercises to these laboratory courses has also increased interactivity among the students and addressed student difficulties in ways that are effective and generally enjoyed by the students. Additionally, an active learning workshop in the summer of 2018 motivated me to use more involved active-learning techniques, including the flipped classroom and inductive learning. Consequently, I flipped the last two modules of an electronic design laboratory in the summer as well as a signal processing lab in the fall of 2018. The effectiveness of these advanced techniques was formally assessed by comparing student work before and after the implementations, and these preliminary results will be discussed. Surveys and interviews were used to measure student perceptions of the teaching techniques, and these results will also be discussed, with promising indications these techniques were positively perceived by the students. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom model is being used in many engineering courses. By guiding students to study course material online or outside of scheduled class time, instructors can focus on hands-on assignments and projects during their interactions with students. The flipped classroom model implements online learning as an effective technique to engage students and maximize learning. However, developing online content is time-consuming and can be challenging. Moreover, the course can be very dependent on previously developed material and can be challenging to adapt for instructors who are new to the course. The challenges to adapt to the new course may also include differences in teaching styles of instructors which may not necessarily be compatible with the existing design of the course. These challenges intensified for large-scale courses with enrollment numbers in the hundreds as several instructors are required each semester. The flipped delivery requires careful collaboration and coordination amongst instructors. Although the results may be very fruitful, this may need a considerable amount of discipline and planning. This paper aims to understand the experience of four instructors who co-taught sections of a large first-year course using flipped course delivery. A collaborative autoethnographic study is used to understand the effective strategies and challenges encountered from the instructors. Six themes emerged from the data on the instructors' experiences of a large-scale flipped classroom implementation with multiple instructors. These six themes include: building a community of teaching; consistency across sections, while still allowing for flexibility; in-person time with students needs to complement videos; setting clear student expectations; pride of what was accomplished; and collaboration brings value but can be challenging. Overall, the results from this qualitative collaborative ethnography provide insight into the experience of four instructors team teaching using a flipped classroom model. These findings can be useful to others who are looking at implementing flipped classrooms when there are multiple sections. Future research can further look into other perspectives, including bringing in student perspective to the instructor experience. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Our control-impact study design paired two sequential rigid-body motion topics in Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics to test the effect of flipped vs. traditional lecture on both student learning and engagement. We alternated instructional methodology (traditional lecture + flipping) between the two sections of Dynamics in spring 2018. The traditional lecture sessions were taught with hand-written note lectures (with limited active learning) and completed two typical numerical homework problems per topic. For the flipped sessions, students watched instructional lecture videos prior to class, worked through a hands-on in-class activity, and completed analytical questions related to the in-class activity which substituted for 1 of the 2 homework problems on each topic. Paired multiple choice pre- and post-assessments were completed by all students and related mid-term exam question were evaluated. Additionally, as part of the post-assessment, several feedback questions evaluated how students felt about the experience and in which classroom method (i.e., traditional or flipped) they felt that they learned better. In general, we found that participating in the traditional lecture or flipped classroom did not significantly affect the performance of students on the paired pre- vs. post-assessments nor on related exam questions. Related to student preference, 38% of students expressed a preference for solely traditional lectures and 48% of students expressed a preference for mostly traditional lectures with a few (~5 sessions per semester) being flipped. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Both project-based learning and flipping the classroom have gained recent popularity in engineering education. These techniques change the classroom environment by placing the responsibility for learning on the students. Through a change in the traditional lecture model, students develop a higher investment in their work and have more agency in the learning process. For this study, a senior level civil engineering class structured around the project-based learning format and focused on geotechnical foundation design was changed from a traditional lecture delivery format to a flipped classroom format. Blending of both instructional techniques resulted in a project driven flipped class, in which the students had the motivation provided by an open-ended design project mixed with the flexibility of a flipped class. The framework for this blended delivery as well as benefits and challenges from both pedagogical approaches identified in the literature are presented in this paper. The potential benefits of both approaches as well as student performance in the course were assessed. Although more research is needed in this field, the results of this study suggest that a blended approach can provide a more balanced educational experience by compensating the weakness of each approach with the benefits from the other. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Active and cooperative learning has shown significant benefits to students in STEM disciplines. Several active and cooperative learning techniques have been introduced to the Introduction to Transportation Engineering course throughout the last four semesters. This work presents a comparison of student learning in the two traditionally taught semesters compared to the two semesters that used active and team-based learning. Introduction to Transportation Engineering is junior level introductory course in traffic engineering and covers vehicle dynamics, geometric design, traffic flow concepts, uninterrupted and interrupted flow analysis, quality of service assessment, and travel demand forecasting. This paper compares two semesters of traditional lecture format (Fall 2014 and Spring 2016) to two semesters using an active and team-based learning format (Spring 2017 and Spring 2018) and explores whether the implementation of active and team-based learning methods had an impact on student learning in the course. To answer this question, common exam questions between the four semesters (grouped into two groups: traditional vs. active/TBL) were compared. In addition, student surveys from the final semester provide insights into the student perception of active and team-based learning components. Results showed a statistically significant improvement in 7/25 (28%) of the compared objectives, a statistically significant decline in 5/25 (20.0%) of compared objectives, and no change in 13/25 (52.0%) of objectives. The majority of the objectives that declined focused on concepts that were not covered in the in-class problems; the majority of objectives that improved were problem-solving type questions similar to the type of questions practiced with active learning. Student feedback showed satisfaction with the active and team-based format. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The pace and delivery style of a traditional engineering lecture makes it difficult for students to stay engaged, motivated, and achieve higher levels of learning in the classroom. Even with an excellent instructor, many students have a hard time managing their time in the classroom and are forced to use a 'write down now, learn later' strategy. Flipped classrooms have gained traction in recent years because this instructional method enables the student to begin the learning process outside of class at their own pace (still under the guidance of the instructor), digest the material prior to class, and subsequently, use the in-class time to participate in active learning strategies that increase engagement between faculty and students, and enhance comprehension of the material. This study pilots a Partially Flipped Classroom (PFC) instructional model in a required geotechnical civil engineering course at UNC Charlotte to formally assess student engagement, perceptions, learning, and gains. This study will investigate whether a PFC model enables students to reach higher-order cognitive skills in accordance with Bloom's Taxonomy. This paper is a work in progress but it presents the extensive research design, summarizes the preliminary student data from this study, and compares the data acquired from the control and treatment groups for the first two content modules (Test 1 and Test 2 data). Extensive qualitative and quantitative data were collected, and the preliminary results are promising. There appears to be a trend of improved overall student performance on quiz and test questions in some areas of the course and there are indications that this instructional model impacts the student's ability to reach higher order cognitive skills in accordance with Blooms Taxonomy. Qualitative feedback collected during focus group interviews clearly align with the objectives of this study, and the treatment group participants have expressed value in the additional time created from the PFC instructional model. Students describe the flipped classroom model as a more relaxed and effective learning environment. The formative feedback regarding the technology and use of time in the flipped classroom collected during this study has been invaluable to the continuous improvement process of this instructional model during the semester. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The contribution of this paper is to propose a blended learning design based on the flipped classroom. In this paper, we take logistics system simulation, a core course for logistics engineering, as an example to design our blended learning based on flipped classroom. Our model of design has three phases, which are before class, in class and after class. For each of the phase five sections are illustrated, including students' activities, teaching tasks, teacher's activities, teaching methods and teaching tools. In application, we adopt one class of the course to conduct our empirical research in detail. The evaluation is considered the following three aspects: learning feedbacks of online video before class, recognition survey of our class design, and assignment completion scores of the students. Survey and questionnaire methods are used in gathering information. According to the statistics, our design is popular for students to learn. Most of the students consider our design of the class has a positive influence on their learning, and they prefer to the flipped classroom. The overall learning result of the students is well and the design has met our expectations. Our design can provide a good reference for study of flipped classroom teaching and can also provide ideas for the development of other courses. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The online survey results showed that the vast majority of students Agreed or Strongly Agreed that the flipped classrooms approach improved their learning experience and level of interaction. While students were initially doubtful about the new format, they adapted quickly and found it to be satisfactory and effective. A worthwhile suggestion raised by plenty of students to the instructor is to spare 15-20 minutes of the beginning of the face-to-face session for questions and answers and to recap the material covered at the primarily online session before starting class problem solving activities. Results of this study provide a statement of encouragement for Civil Engineering faculty to implement flipped-classrooms as a contemporary and effective teaching method. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The focus of the project is to investigate the impact and effect of flipped classes on the performance of engineering students in an intermediate physics course (Physics 2). Students' performance was compared to other classes, which were taught using a traditional teaching approach. The midterm and final exam results were higher for the group of students who were taught using the flipped classes approach by 2.4, 4.18 and 4.85 points in all three summative assessment tools: Term Test 1, Term Test 2 and the Final Exam respectively, with p values of < 0.001. Flipping classes allowed students to learn at their own pace, which was facilitated by the IT and LMS tools that allowed students to pause, rewind, and review lectures, as well as increase the amount of individualized learning. The conclusion of the case study strongly supports blended learning as a teaching methodology, which promotes interactive classroom activities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This can result in the learning outcomes and delivery plan not being met. This project was designed to prepare students to be familiar with elementary level concepts through independent learning and proceed with higher order thinking and learning during the class. To achieve this, the approach was through the use of technology enabling teachers to take their classrooms beyond the physical boundaries and make the materials available via the mode of a virtual classroom. The teacher's presence in the virtual class was made possible through small videos presented by the teachers with 18 prepared modules accessible on all web-enabled devices. Students were required to complete the assigned tasks in their own time, changing the teacher's role to being a facilitator in the learning process. This research effort not only improved their basic math skills, but also motivated them towards independent learning using available technological tools/resources.The advanced tracking system of the "Khan Academy" website allowed the students to monitor their own progress and learn independently, and Wahida Dastakeer has over 20 years of experience teaching for a consortium of programs, which includes life sciences, chemistry, and general studies at the Higher Colleges of Technology. She is the recipient of the "Flipped Classroom" award and the "Green award" by the HCT-Dubai colleges, in addition to the "GESS education" award also allowed faculty to identify the students' comprehension and design the delivery of the classroom sessions accordingly. The ease of accessibility of all of the above in a "flipped classroom" also nurtured peer tutoring.The results of the previous semester's exam were compared and the results of students using the flipped approach were found to have improved. The number of failures in each section had decreased. Further, the average mark rose substantially across all 112 students. The student survey also indicated that a majority of them found the flipped classroom approach very useful, interesting and motivating. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The inverted class or Flipped Classroom teaching methodology that proposes that the work of certain learning processes be transferred out of the classroom, that is to say that the students prepare the subjects outside the alma mater, through the use of information and communication technologies ( TIC) and uses time in the classroom to carry out activities that require greater participation and student - teacher interaction, to debate ideas and development of constructs and mindfacts appropriate to generational change, management that is sustained with the support of new technologies; In conclusion, the method under study reverses the activities that are normally done in classes, with the activities that are done at home, that is, the technique proposes a change of paradigm more adjusted to the current realities of teaching. In order to demonstrate the potential of the Inverted Class proposal, the professors participating in this research reviewed in depth the results achieved with the application of this technique within the subject Capital Market pertaining to the degree of Business Administration and the financial area specifically to compare the results; To obtain the corresponding metrics, a perception measurement was displayed to students of two cohorts for the year 2017, distributed in 4 rooms per semester, and an average of 25 students per class, for a total of 212 students participating in the methodology belonging to the schools of economic and accounting administrative sciences of the private Universities of the region, where the technique object of study was applied and orienting others under the traditional system of education. This was elaborated in light of the case research approach, abstracting the results through the use of qualitative and quantitative methods, obtaining empirical evidence in the significant improvement of the students in terms of results and appropriation of competences, with an increase in the participation of students, and a strong orientation with discipline to the management of tasks and the research component, through interaction with technological tools placed at the service of pedagogy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the application of the principles of Blended Learning to the teaching of the concepts of Tribology. Blended Learning is a fast developing approach towards the direction of transforming teaching of engineering courses by actively involving students into the learning process and thus reportedly resulting in higher levels of student achievement than purely face-to-face or purely online classes. Flipping the Classroom is a proposal in the context of Blended Learning which suggests that in-class students’ activities, supported by learning material made available to them in advance, could replace the traditional scheme of teacher led lectures followed by homework. Trying to take advantage of the benefits of Blended Learning, we introduced a Tribology Flipped Classroom within a Machine Design course of the Mechanical Engineering Educators Curriculum. The lesson was planned following established design principles. The content was divided in (a): The preparation material which was mainly pre-existing resources including video, notes, slides, taking into account the difficulties that students face on the topic as well self-assessment tests; all these being available on-line. (b): In-class activities including a variety of problems such as, decision and design problems, logical exercises, and debates. In class students worked individually and in groups, participating also in a peer review activity. The evaluation of the project revealed a quite positive view of the participating students on the flipped classroom approach, in comparison to the traditional lectures which they have attended. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

There is evidence that flipping learning can result in more effective learning processes and outcomes. However, not much is known about students’ learning process in terms of their interactions while working collaboratively in a flipped class context. This understanding is essential to inform lecturers’ timely and relevant facilitation of student learning. This paper reports on the findings from a study focused on the interactions, specifically types of talk, first-year undergraduate engineering students engaged in while collaboratively solving problem tasks in their practical lab sessions as part of a flipped class learning approach in a New Zealand university. Data were collected from a six-week video observation of student interactions. Herrington and Oliver’s (1999) analytical framework on higher order, lower order, procedural, and social talk was used to analyse the video data. Findings revealed that the highest proportion of student interactions were procedural in nature followed by higher order, lower order, and finally, social talk types. These indicate the potential of the flipped class approach in fostering higher order talk in support of learning. Implications for practice are offered. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We investigate the context of flipped learning in higher education from the standpoint that academia is focused on basic knowledge production at low levels of technology readiness, but is educating students who aim to be employed in processes at higher level of technology readiness. This leads to a conflict of interest between veristically oriented perceptions, decisions, and actions of the academe, versus utilitaristically oriented perceptions, decisions, and actions of the businesses, which translates to the classroom through students' desire to apply knowledge and professor's desire to deepen it. We argue that the classroom is an ideal opportunity for combining the best of both worlds, as well as exchanging knowledge between them. Moreover, we argue that the approach of flipped classroom both synchronizes the incentives of the learner and the learned, fulfilling sufficient and necessary conditions to render teaching effectiveness the only stable mechanism for rising grades (contrary to others that yield grade inflation). Finally, we argue that flipped classroom fulfills the conditions psychologists have established for achievement of the state of flow, an optimal experience of frictionless absorption in the action a person is performing. We propose that large 2-crossing-critical graphs, a recently characterized class of graphs, is an ideal theoretical tool to test these assumptions in a laboratory setting of teaching graph theory, and test an implementation of the listed ideas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flipped classroom (FC) has gained significant recognition in higher education as a way to fundamentally alter the course structure and revolutionize the teaching and learning experience. FC entails assigning digitally mediated instructional content as preparation before class, and thus free up class time to cultivate higher-order thinking skills, problem solving, threshold concepts and engage in collaborative learning. Despite a predominantly large interest in this educational innovation, there are a number of pedagogical challenges that need to be highlighted. This paper examines the educational implications of using FC in a higher education context, which emerged from my own experiences with the systematic use of FC in teaching a course in Change Management (CM). Based on recent literature within the use of FC, I discuss both the pedagogical rationale and the critical points that I have become aware of in my teaching. I thus extend the argument to question the adherence to any particular model or delivery modes, as in the case of FC, which risks reinforcing various content transmission paradigms. Rather, the attention should at all times be on the underlying pedagogy, focused on developing, delivering, and evaluating learning experiences that promote effective and significant improvements in student achievement. Using technology to enhance learning requires a more radical redesign of the teaching and learning experience, which takes advantage of the technological affordances for creating hybrid, flexible learning and enabling new ways of knowing, working and becoming within and across various disciplinary and professional fields. Based on recent literature regarding FC, I identify the pedagogical challenges that exist, despite the popularity of FC as educational innovation. I compare some of the critical points with my own experience with adopting FC in a course in Change Management (CM). I discuss the pros and cons with FC in the light of a written student evaluation of experienced learning from the CM-course as FC. The discussion will lean against research in university pedagogy and learning design. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This technique has been employed in several areas of knowledge; however, its application within a Pavements course has not been reported yet. So, this article aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the flipped classroom technique applied to this subject. Two research questions related to the influence of the flipped model on both, students' final grades and their opinion about its effectiveness were carried out. The experiment was applied to four groups: two groups took the course with the traditional method while the other two attended the flipped classroom model. Students from group A-B had to attend a face-to-face lecture, while learners from group C-D had to watch a pre-recorded lecture before class attendance. As result, students in the traditional model got better average final grades than those of the flipped one; however, students, in general, were more satisfied with the flipped model. The flipped model promoted self-learning and proactivity from students to look for what is unknown to them, which is a quite valuable skill in the field of Civil Engineering. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We propose using Conceptual Questions to assess class pre-work and improve students' grasp of core concepts of the reading material, as well as facilitate problem-based learning, in electromagnetics classes of the junior year of the electrical engineering program. We also investigate the effectiveness and impact of a teaching method based on the combined use of Conceptual Questions and partially flipped classroom on students' academic performance in an electromagnetics course. Best practices in engineering education require the students to engage very intensely in the assigned pre-work, which must be meaningfully motivated and assessed. A general way to address this need is the use of Conceptual Questions, namely, multiple-choice questions that focus on understanding and mastery of core concepts in electromagnetics, while requiring no or very little calculations, in class pre-work. According to our approach, prior to each classroom meeting, students complete an online, timed quiz with a set of meticulously designed Conceptual Questions concerning the preassigned reading topics, which enables the implementation of a partially flipped classroom instruction of electromagnetics. This study discusses and evaluates such use of conceptual quizzes, with the impact on students' learning, attitude, and success, analyzed and assessed in multiple ways. Student performance on midterm and final exams and overall class scores (in a class with 83 students), including both the D/F/W and the A-level grade rates, as well as their results on the Electromagnetics Concept Inventory assessment instrument, have shown substantial improvements under the proposed method when compared to the traditional pedagogical approach of previous years. Overall, this is one of the most extensive applications of such questions in the electromagnetics area, and likely any electrical-engineering area. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The impact of flipping an engineering course on student learning outcomes remains an open question because the literature presents a perplexing array of results. In this multi-year study, we evaluate the impact of flipping a first-year project-based engineering design course. We pose two questions: (1) Does a flipped project-based engineering design course produce different levels of mastery of engineering design process knowledge compared to the lecture version of the course? (2) Do students in the lecture class and flipped class achieve the same levels of design process knowledge when given tasks that range in difficulty? Three strands of data were used to assess design process knowledge: First drafts of team technical memos, pre- and post-critiques of a Gantt chart of a proposed design process, and an exam. Teams in the flipped classroom performed significantly better on the technical memos that evaluated solution ideas and established a testing plan, both of which required high-level cognitive capacities. However, no differences were found between lecture and flipped models for the exam or technical memo that established design criteria, which required low-level cognitive activities. The Gantt chart assessment produced mixed results. This study concludes that flipping a project-based design course can significantly improve student learning on more difficult tasks. We urge researchers and educators to consider the tasks and assignments given to students when drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of flipped pedagogy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {MOOC-based flipped courses are a new educational trend that has been on the rise over the last few years. However, experimental studies providing empirical evidence about the effectiveness of these educational approaches are scarce. This paper presents the results of a quasi-experiment of a MOOC-based flipped course. The study was conducted on a mandatory third year course on Organizational Behavior in the School of Engineering at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile with 316 students organized into experimental and control groups. Both groups had the same teacher, shared the same content and the assessment plan, but the experimental group followed a Flipped Classroom methodology and the control group the traditional lecture methodology. The objective of this quasi-experiment is to compare the learning outcomes of each group and analyze the experimental group’s adoption of the initiative. The quasi-experiment lasted an entire semester, and the preliminary findings show that students who participated in the flipped course obtained statistically significantly better grades in the first course exam than students in the control group. Also, the interactions with the MOOC’s content in the experimental group show a regular behavior, suggesting that they adopted the class methodology well. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A review of existing literature shows we can still raise no conclusion, and in particular when dealing with face to face (F2F) studies. In this article, we analyze the performance of a first-year engineering course, offered in a higher education institution (a public university). The course under analysis lasts for 12 weeks and is offered with flipped classroom methodology. Activities that students should follow out of class are scheduled in advance, and communicated to students during the learning period. In addition, there has been a previous effort to align learning activities and learning outcomes. The goal is to determine if prediction models fed with data gathered during the learning process can provide an accurate estimator of students at risk. This risk evaluation will be done considering as core data those reflecting activity, being of particular relevance, traces stored in LMS as part of the learning process. Our study demonstrates performance can be estimated based on this data, with increasing accuracy over time. Activity performed by the student is linked to academic result, and this relation is verified even when not taking into account any graded results obtained during the learning process. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Students in undergraduate level encounter difficulty in understanding the topic of project management since there have no prior knowledge before the course. This paper aimed to determine the effectiveness of flipped teaching and active learning in Project Management module for undergraduate students in Civil Engineering. However, the paper discussed the effective practices in teaching and learning project management and their impacts into students' learning experience, and assessments development and marking. The Padlet and SurveyMonkey e-tools were used to collect students' feedback on the instructor practice; either by tagging comments or filling questionnaire. The results indicated that the use of multiple in-class activities and digital technology in a flipped classroom are important to enhance students' performance. It is also observed that the use of multiple assessments engaged students deeply with the course and provide deeper learning. Students' performance in summative assessments showed that there is a noticeable improve in student's scores in the current semester in contrast with previous semester where traditional teaching was practiced. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {At present, there is a wide variety of teaching methods and educational strategies mediated by technology: e-learning, m-learning, b-learning, gamification, flipped classroom, bring your own devices (BYOD), etc. This methodological variety creates an important student-participation space where challenges, problem solving and collaboration are put to the testing. Due to the need for communication, portability and ubiquity, several of these methods use mobile devices to achieve their goal. Laptops, smartphones and tablets, with access to wireless networks, can be used to improve teacher–student interaction and thereby stimulate students’ motivation, participation and active learning. Gamification is a teaching-learning strategy, which incorporates knowledge based on games that can support and mostly motivate the work of students and teachers. This document presents the results of a study using the Kahoot Platform, which is a web service of social and gamified education learning, in order to create evaluations changed into games of knowledge and competition among students. When it is used as a questionnaire, it challenges users to answer the questions posed, with a controlled response time, accumulated points, badges and a podium with the first five places. This leads to an active and dynamic learning due to the strong playful component, competitive and teamwork. The results of the research indicate that students improved participation and motivation in classes, besides checking that they had better results when working with mobile devices. These data will allow to analyze future perspectives about the use of the learning platform based on games as an assistance in the teaching-learning process. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

How does technology intersect with English teaching in ways that benefit learning? A possible approach would align with integrating web-based strategies and optimising class time through new methodologies, techniques and resources. In this study, a group of university engineering students were taught with simulations to aid their learning of English as a foreign language. These engineering students were taught English through both class-based and a large-scale real-time web-based simulation. We present the results of quantitative analysis of students' oral production. The goal was to show whether simulation-based instruction contributes to significant progress in oral language production in English. The results indicate that students progressed significantly in four language-related areas: vocabulary, pronunciation, variety of expression and grammar. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Today, thanks to the development of mobile technologies, mobile learning has become widespread. New methods of mobile learning have emerged; we have heard lately by the flipped classroom. This method involves reversing the task traditionally performed in class with the task traditionally performed at home. When we talk about mobile learning, we are talking about a learner who learns in a mobile context and in different situations. Hence, the need for adapting educational content and contextual mobile learning becomes critical. Several research studies have been performed taking into account the context notion. According to our research few scientific works have been proposed taking into account the context in the flipped classroom. In this paper, we present the model of our approach, called Smart Enhanced Context-Aware for Flipped Mobile Learning: SECA-FML. This approach takes into account the different context dimensions in order to provide learners with a content format adapted to their contexts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The use of flipped-classroom methodology (FC) has increased recently, however, there is a lack of quantitative data on students’ performance. A FC has been applied into a group (80 students) of an obligatory subject of the 2nd course in an Energetic Engineering Bachelor. A second group has been taught with the traditional methodology (72 students) to compare the results. The FC requires students to obtain background knowledge prior to a face-to face class meeting, and reserves in-class time for applying knowledge to solve problems. This is the opposite of the traditional lecture-based classroom, in which students passively attend didactic lectures from the instructor, then study the content and complete assignments after class. The main objectives of this research were to measure the impact of learning (with special attention to really active students), reduce absenteeism, increase exam attendance, and analyze how participating students view their experience with this methodology. The results show that the flipped-classroom model has a direct impact on student learning (or grades), especially in students with a high degree of involvement (with grades about 1.5 points higher). In addition, the grades standard deviation values were lower (in about one point), ensuring a better general students level. The students are a little reluctant to this new methodology, but thanks to it, they tend to work more (12% of the students work more hours per week), to attend more to class (at least 10% more), and to attend in a higher ratio to exams (around 20%). © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Transport Phenomena is a core subject in Chemical Engineering studies. Its fundamentals need significant effort to be understood. Furthermore, students must apply theory to solve practical engineering problems, and it is usually problem resolution which has the largest weight in course assessment. However, due to the high amount of theory that must be covered in Transport Phenomena courses, usually little classroom time is reserved for practice and problem-solving skills are not worked in class. This constitutes a serious misalignment between learning activities, expected outcomes and evaluation. In this article, we propose the flipped classroom as a suitable methodology to solve this issue. As a pilot study, we flipped one unit of the Transport Phenomena course of the Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering. Theory was provided through whiteboard animated video before the classroom sessions. Classroom time was mainly dedicated to participative discussion and problem solving in small groups. Satisfaction questionnaires were used to monitor student perception of learning quality before and after the methodology update. Student judgement on the interest of the subject and the value of the learnt concepts boosted about 20% on average with the flipped classroom. Around 70% of the surveyed students reported that the new methodology increased their motivation and that it helped them to learn both theory and practice. These results indicate that the flipped classroom is suitable for highly-technical classes with a large amount of complex theory, and it helps in the understanding and application of such theory. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Our approach depends on exploratory–engaging philosophy comprising of flipping classroom, open-ended problem-based collaborative learning and its peer assessment leading to implementation of real-time online projects. Our inspiration was to make students proficient in DBMSs using an active learning strategy so that engagement and collaboration with the instructor and learners can be increased in the class while instructing both technical and managerial skills met in real-world scenario along with a balance between theory and practices. In this paper, we have presented our approach and challenges encountered and recommendations associated with the same. It has been found that if appropriately arranged and executed, collaborative learning strategies can help learners in achieving the learning outcomes of the course. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The ESP course enabled the developers to achieve a higher degree of professional focus than conventional ESP textbooks provide. This paper focuses on the design of the course syllabus, its organization in LMS MOODLE, and analysis of the two year approbation of both experimental ESP course and Database Systems course given in English. Although the results of the first year ESP course approbation were successful, the survey conducted at the end of the first year teaching DB course in English highlighted some problem zones. This resulted in modifying the way of teaching the ESP course during the second year approbation. In particular, some elements of the flipped classroom methodology were introduced with the aim of allocating more time for discussing complex concepts of the discipline in class so the students become familiar with them in advance while doing their homework. The results of the survey conducted at the end of the second year approbation as well as the results of the second year DB course acquisition are discussed. Authors conclude that online component of the experimental ESP course makes it more flexible, allows adopting it to changing requirements of DB course lecturer which can be achieved only in case of close interdepartmental cooperation. Future work plan is outlined. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This structured review examined (academic) publications on flipped or inverted classrooms based on all Scopus database (n = 530) references available until mid-June 2016. The flipped or inverted classroom approach has gained widespread attention during the latest decade and is based on the idea of improving student learning by prepared self-studies via technology-based resources (‘flips’) followed by high-quality, in-class teaching and learning activities. However, only a few attempts have been made to review the knowledge of the field of interest more systematically. This article seeks to address this problem and investigates what constitutes the research on flipped classrooms and, in particular, to examine the knowledge contributions with the field so far in relation to the wider research topic of educational technology. This review found that the current state of flipped classrooms as a field of interest is growing fast, with a slight conference preference and a focus on higher education and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) area contributions, with the US as the predominant geographical context. It is concluded that studies on flipped classrooms are dominated by studies in higher education sector and are relatively local in character. The research tends not to interact beyond the two clusters of general education/educational technology and subject-specific areas. This implies that knowledge contributions related to the flipped classroom approach are relatively siloed and fragmented and have yet to stabilise. Academically and socially, the research is quite scattered, and only local evidence and experiences are available. The knowledge contributions within this field of interest seem to be anecdotal rather than systematically researched. To a large extent, the research lacks anchoring in, for example, learning theory or instructional design known from educational technology traditions and which would have helped much of the flipped classroom research to examine aspects of the flipped classroom approach more fully. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, there is a lack of quantitative data on students' performance, especially in engineering courses. A flipped-classroom methodology has been developed in two different engineering degrees with 167 students. In both degrees also a control group with 156 students has been taught using the classical methodology. Through the data collected it is possible to measure the impact of learning (through the usual exams), to reduce the class absenteeism and to increase the exams attendance. Also, the students' implication with the new methodology can be checked by the use of YouTube analytics. The results show that the flipped-classroom model improves the results, at least in partial examinations. Furthermore, as the marks dispersion are lower, can be state that diversity has been treated in a better way. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Moreover, the study compared a half-semester flipped classroom and a traditional classroom whereby the experimental class reverted to the traditional format after the midterm for assessing students' receptivity towards two learning environments. Four assessments, two surveys, repeated semi-structured interviews, and two sets of open-ended questions were collected. The findings revealed that student learning achievement and motivation were improved according to assessment scores by the application of the flipped classroom. However, student's receptivity towards flipping varied because of the large amount of time and effort spent on the course. Students in the experimental group also showed insignificant differences after returning to a traditional classroom. The study suggests that blended flipped and traditional programs are scheduled together to increase student receptivity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The rapid development in communication technology has inadvertently changed how present learners acquire knowledge. Learners of today have evolved in the way they learn compared to their teachers, professors, or their course instructors learned when they were students. To meet the needs of the learners, lecturers have resorted to innovative ways in restructuring their instructional approach in university classrooms. The flipped- classroom is one of such approach which focusses more classroom time for homework, project work, and practices but prior to this, students need to read or watch and understand lectures (e.g. through video postings on youTube) before entering classes. Inverted classroom is not merely a replacement of technology in the classroom but rather a concept which holds that it is more valuable in guiding students with the help of learning communities in class in developing understanding of knowledge. The motivation behind this study is to inform the implication of inverted classroom specifically in non-technical course subject at a private higher institution. The research aimed to develop the Flip Learning implementation model for Ethnic Relation course subject at undergraduate level. The study adopted Interpretive Structural Modelling as main technique in developing the model. The findings resulted in nine instructional strategies for implementing flipped-learning of non-technical course subjects among undergraduate engineering students. The findings will implicate on how flipped-learning could be addressed for different context of learning at undergraduate level. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A flipped classroom has introduced a new way of learning where students need to familiarize with the content before the in-class session so that more time would be allocated for class activities and face-to-face engagement with the lecturer. In this study, an implementation of a partially flipped classroom for over one semester of enrolment of Transport Phenomena course has been conducted to look at how far the flipped classroom is effective in helping the students to improve their results. Learning materials such as videos, notes, and postcards are given to students before the commencement of the class. Meanwhile, group activities such as informal cooperative learning activities, i.e. think-pair-share, Intermittent focused discussion, etc. were also implemented during the class. The results showed improved marks for test, assignment, and quiz obtained by students as a comparison before implementation of a flipped classroom. For instance, 61 % of the students improved in their test marks, 70% improved in the assignment, and, 31 % improved in the quiz. Students were also improved in their communication skill and team work amongst them. In a nutshell, a flipped classroom method can help students in enhancing their way of learning, and they will eventually become independent learners which is one of the primary attributes of UTP graduates. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Although development of critical thinking skills has emerged as an important issue in undergraduate education, implementation of pedagogies targeting these skills across different science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines has proved challenging. Our goal was to assess the impact of targeted interventions in 1) an introductory cell and molecular biology course, 2) an intermediate-level evolutionary ecology course, and 3) an upper-level biochemistry course. Each instructor used Web-based videos to flip some aspect of the course in order to implement active-learning exercises during class meetings. Activities included process-oriented guided-inquiry learning, model building, case studies, clicker-based think–pair–share strategies, and targeted critical thinking exercises. The proportion of time spent in active-learning activities relative to lecture varied among the courses, with increased active learning in intermediate/upper-level courses. Critical thinking was assessed via a pre/posttest design using the Critical Thinking Assessment Test. Students also assessed their own learning through a self-reported survey. Students in flipped courses exhibited gains in critical thinking, with the largest objective gains in intermediate and upper-level courses. Results from this study suggest that implementing active-learning strategies in the flipped classroom may benefit critical thinking and provide initial evidence suggesting that underrepresented and first-year students may experience a greater benefit. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study analyzes the effectiveness of adding educational gaming elements into the online lecture system of the flipped classroom as a method to increase participation and interest in online preparation before class. This study held an “understanding sequence” for 20 classes during the 7-week automation equipment class with 30 s year high school students in Incheon's specialized technical high school as target. After the class, the learning attitude of learners was measured through surveys and in-depth interviews. As a result, first, it was found that the degree of preparation participation in flip learning using gaming elements had a statistically significant increase from 65.56% to 78.89%, compared with the traditional flip learning using YouTube. Second, comparing the academic achievements showed a diagnostic assessment of 57.44 before applying the gaming elements and 20.17 after the application. However, for summative assessment, the degree after applying gaming elements was statistically higher at 84.52 than the degree before application, which was 78.86. Third, comparing academic achievement with word game results showed no significant correlation, and it is judged that all students were able to enjoy word games, regardless of their grades. Also, when the average word game scores were compared based on students’ grades, mid-upper level students had statistically significant higher scores than upper level students. Lastly, analysis on the correlation between attitude and word game showed that there is a quantitatively high correlation between the ranking system's competitive spirit and interest. The ranking system increased competitive spirit, as well as interest. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The SPOC course has been online and run for 2 years on Zhejiang Institutions of Higher Learning Online Open Course Sharing Platform. Our teaching practices show that the online/offline blended learning combines the students’ online self-study through micro-videos before class with traditional classroom, and greatly improves the learning efficiency.

	abstract = {Sometimes, at the beginning of the class, and in basic sciences courses, professors use some didactic materials or demonstrative experiments. However, this feature is just an introductory tool that does not necessarily guarantee the success of the attention, much less the learning of students belonging to the generation of digital natives, known as the Generation Z (born between 1994 and 2009). Additionally, college students, at present, are immersed in the 4th Industrial Revolution; so, as educators, we focus on 3D printers, electronics, robotics and IoT. For this reason, our strategy is to engage the students in their learning process with new educational methodologies, face different projects and foster new challenges in the teaching-learning process. The learning objective is to integrate the students in an active participation to build their knowledge and develop their skills. This work shows the efforts carried out to increase the students' motivation and interest of self-taught. They must be creative and exposed students to information that runs careers which are far from the exact and natural sciences. The pilot test was implemented in the Physics course belonging to the Business and Information Engineering careers. The combinations of various methodologies such as Flipped Classroom, Project Based Learning, Cooperative Learning and Design Thinking, among others, were used. The introduction of basic principles of robotics and programming language, ending with the student's training in 3D printing technologies were the key that students develop the capacity of working in a multidisciplinary team and applying the mentioned methodologies. Also, a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis is presented not only for the group projects generated but also of students' performance in their exams. Finally, the results obtained are compared with those of previous semesters, showing that the aggregation of several learning strategies are useful and essential since they have a direct impact on skills and demonstrations of knowledge as a response to educational process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Unlike traditional whiteboards which require the lecturer to have his/her back to the camera during recording, the Lightboard is an innovative technology which allows the lecturer to face the camera while recording the lesson. Since the clear glass board of the Lightboard is lit up internally with LEDs, the writing on the board appears as a lighted marker. Quantitative data for the study was analyzed by comparing student performance on in-class learning activities in which the pre-class component (flipped classrooms require students to review lesson material prior to class) included Lightboard videos with identical assignments in which Lightboard videos were not included. Additional quantitative and qualitative data was collected through an end-of-semester questionnaire containing short answer and Likert-scale questions addressing the impact of the Lightboard videos on student learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The concept of formative assessment is considered by many to play an important role in enhancing teaching in higher engineering education. In this paper, the concept of the flipped classroom as part of a blended learning curriculum is highlighted as an ideal medium through which formative assessment practices arise. Whilst the advantages of greater interaction between students and lecturers in classes are numerous, there are often clear disadvantages associated with the independent home-study component that complements timetabled sessions in a flipped classroom setting, specifically, the popular method of replacing traditional classroom teaching with video lectures. This leads to a clear lack of assurances that the cited benefits of a flipped classroom approach are echoed in the home-study arena. Over the past three years, the authors have sought to address identified deficiencies in this area of blended learning through the development of database-driven e-learning software with the capability of introducing formative assessment practices to independent home-study. This paper maps out aspects of two specific evolving practices at separate institutions, from which guiding principles of incorporating formative assessment aspects into e-learning software are identified and highlighted in the context of independent home-study as part of a flipped classroom approach. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A bottom-up of flipped learning model based on Blooms' taxonomy of cognitive domain has been produced. A Learning Management System (LMS), known as 'Schoology' adopted as a platform to share the recorded video lectures for students' learning before attending class. Three main activities are proposed and recommended for students' learning outside of the class, namely, 'Watching', 'Note-Taking', and 'Quiz' (WNQ), while group discussions and peer-evaluation are two mains activities practiced in the class. This study suggests that a bottom-up of flipped learning model based on Blooms' taxonomy is potentially implemented not only for teaching a Cross-Cultural Understanding but also other subjects. Finally, this study recommends that the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher education or policymakers in Indonesia, including instructors, students, and community members, must be actively involved in developing, supporting, and maintaining a transformed learning culture, from being traditional to a technology-based learning environment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an alternative approach to homework, which asked the students to create and solve a problem set. The homework was one of several activities in an Introductory Calculus course taught using the Flipped Classroom method. The homework was meant to replace readings that were usually assigned to prepare students for the next class. Results from the experiment shows that this type of homework had a large impact on increasing students' understanding of the taught material. Students who were given this homework, on average, had a 29.98 grade points increase in posttest scores compared to students who were given the regular reading assignments. This increase can be attributed to students being better prepared for classes. By doing the homework, students were made to review the provided materials and had more problem sets to practice on. Moreover, students' reception of this type of homework was positive. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, flipping large advanced analytical courses is challenging as it is overly reliant on students' diligence for learning. This paper shows how a 100% flipping was achieved in a large final year undergraduate electrical engineering course by adopting unique approaches. A variety of activities both online and in-class were used and co-run by student mentors. These helped to create a community of learners both inside and outside the classroom. The assessment structure was changed to help students' reflect on their understanding. Project based learning was also implemented to help students in developing deep and long-lasting learning. The results, in comparison with previous years of this course offering, show that there is a significant improvement in students' learning outcomes and engagement. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study employed a quasi-experimental approach by comparing pre- and post-class results of students who underwent three different learning methods, namely: (1) model-based flipped classroom supported by modern teaching technology (MFC), (2) flipped classroom (FC), and (3) model-based classroom. Students who underwent the MFC method achieved significant improvements in the 5 phases of the physics modeling process and gave higher scores in the 4 dimensions of classroom teaching quality evaluation, namely (1) communication and cooperation, (2) application and learning, (3) curriculum learning, and (4) participation. The model-based flipping classroom supported by modern teaching technologies (MFC) used in this study effectively guided students through the 3 steps of new knowledge construction during the learning process, provided an empirical reference for applying modern teaching technologies and flipping classroom teaching methods in actual settings, and inspired new mindsets for applying and developing teaching theories. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Meanwhile, interviews were conducted to gather information about students' opinions towards the flipped lessons. The data analyses indicated that the flipped lessons were more effective than the traditional lessons, since the speaking test scores of the experimental group significantly improved whereas the control group did not show any significant improvement; students generally held supportive opinions towards the flipped classroom lessons and their disagreements and suggestions were also summarized to improve the lessons for further studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Therefore, the emphasis of these courses is on the methods and skills in problem solving. However, the solution manuals for most textbooks can be downloaded from the internet, and thus many students just copy the solutions without trying to solve the assigned homework problems. If this short-cut approach is not effectively prohibited, these students will learn very little in these courses. When they start to take the following advanced courses, such as Fluid Mechanics and Electronic Circuits, these students will have tremendous trouble and are likely to fail. There are a number of approaches that can avoid this problem, such as the flipped classroom. We adopted a new approach: A subgroup of students were asked to redesign the homework problems, and then the altered problems were assigned to the whole class. There are two direct benefits in this approach. First, students cannot find the solutions of these redesigned problems, so they have to work out the solution by themselves. Second, in the designing process students can develop a deeper understanding of the underlying knowledge structure and are empowered in the problem solving process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, many find the perceived barriers to developing and coordinating content and activities for a flipped classroom daunting. Here, frequently asked questions generated during multiple workshops designed to overcome barriers for active learning in engineering courses are addressed, resulting in a guide to flipping the engineering classroom.

In the past, engaging and interesting engineering students in geology at Villanova University and Drexel University has been a challenge. Therefore, the authors collaborated to overhaul their respective geology courses with the goals of improving student engagement, learning, and satisfaction. Based on literature supporting the potential benefits of a flipped (inverted) classroom, as well as previous success by other faculty at Villanova University in flipping other required engineering courses, the authors decided to change geology from a mostly lecture format to a flipped classroom format. However, the time and resources required to convert a course to a flipped format can quickly become overwhelming, especially for tenure-track faculty. Nonetheless, the authors were able to successfully, and efficiently, flip their geology courses by utilizing several simple strategies that leveraged free, existing resources. Comparison of student evaluation scores from previous years (lecture format) with the newer flipped format as well as student surveys indicated improved student perception of use of class time, instructor interaction, amount learned, how intellectually stimulating the course was, quality of instruction, and overall value of the course to their education. The strategies used to flip the geology course with limited time and resources are useful for other engineering courses as well, and are described in detail. Challenges encountered with implementing the new format at both universities also are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The objective of this evidence-based study is to synthesize best practices for developing flipped classroom material in large-scale first year courses. These best practices are extracted from three years of flipped classroom implementation experience in both technical and design engineering courses mandatory for first year students. This research will present valuable lessons and analyze differences between the suitability of different course types for the flipped educational model. Best Practice #1: Implementation of the flipped teaching and learning approach should be associated with three phases. Starting with a pre-classroom phase, followed by an in-class active learning approach, and finally the third stage that allows students to practice a real-world application of the concepts that learned in the two previous stages. Best Practice #2: An online learning approach should add value to, rather than replace, in-class learning. The varied video types facilitate efficient and effective individual learning, but they do not include collaboration or interactivity. The online material should be used to enable in-class creative problem-solving and applied learning led by an instructor. From a different angle, this also means that flipped classrooms teaching approach should not be chosen as a cost-saving or time-saving option. Best Practice #3: Flipped classroom instructors should not rely solely on traditional performance assessment of students. One of the advantages of online teaching is the huge size of invaluable data that is collected as students access the provided online learning resources. For example, learning management systems such as Desire2Learn are often used as a platform to provide teaching and learning media. Most learning management systems provide substantial amounts of data regarding student interaction and related use behavior. Mining this data allows us to analyze students' study habits. Although not all available data may show significant statistical correlation with students' study behavior, a data mining approach with the support of additional data collection via questionnaire or surveys can lead to a valuable set of information for improving the curriculum or teaching methods. This paper will present implementation and feedback findings from multiple flipped offerings of an introductory programming course and a first-year engineering design and communication course. In addition to detailing the best practices above, this study will compare and analyze the impact of flipped material in technical versus design-based courses. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing push to add more digital resources (such as video lectures) to undergraduate engineering courses, enabling strategies such as the flipped classroom or formats such as online education. Yet in this rapid push, it is important that educators remain circumspect about new methods until they have been proven effective. While online videos have been proven very useful in various lecture scenarios, the purpose of this study was to determine whether a video "review session" may be effective preparation for midterm exams. At a University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands, Fluid Mechanics is a part of the first-year curriculum for both Chemistry and Chemical Engineering students. In 2015, an online video was generated based on prior-used material for midterm review sessions and shared with two of the four sections. The hour-long exam comprised four multiple-choice questions on theoretical concepts and two multi-part computational problems in which students solved for quantities like volumetric flow rate and pressure drop. Also printed on the exam paper after the problems was a brief, six-question survey asking about the students' manner of preparation (attendance, book usage, and use of Learning Management System (LMS) materials), whether they watched the video, and what sort of math and physics they had had in their high school courses and exit exams. Only one student, of the eighty-one tested, did not answer the survey questions. Interestingly, the students who obtained the video from the instructor (40% of students) scored lower on the 10-point grading scale than those who did not-a 5.77 average for the former group compared to 6.22 for the latter; while the two students who answered that they had obtained the video from a fellow student rather than from the instructor averaged a 5.05. The survey results showed that a majority of students who reported watching the video also reported not using the online materials (consisting of practice exams with solutions): 19 did not use the LMS materials, out of a total of 32 who watched the video. For the control group (those who did not watch the video), this proportion was fifty/fifty (24 out of 48). While these results may not be statistically significant, it suggests that many students who watched the video used it as a replacement for other study methods rather than as a supplement to them. While the use of this video may have worked to these students' detriment, it should be noted that much stronger indicators of student success on the exam included class attendance, whether they purchased or obtained the book, and whether or not advanced math geared toward the physical sciences was a part of their high school exit exams. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Students entering college settings are: increasingly computer literate, users of digital technologies, visually driven, and have been exposed to active learning styles in high schools. Notions of technology, visual learners, and engaging environments are directly and indirectly shaping how we are expected to teach. When students are asked their preferences in classroom learning, the author has noticed that responses vary with preferences for PowerPoint slides, chalkboard notes, projects, flipped classrooms and utilization of computer software. Based on these common and upcoming learning mechanisms, the author is experimenting with implementing different techniques in a structural steel design class offered to undergraduates. This course is a 4<sup>th</sup> year senior-level steel design type class that educates Architectural Engineering students specifically about the fundamentals and practicality of designing steel structures for gravity loading according to AISC. The test bed for this study looks into various techniques based on segmenting topics into different styles for teaching evaluation. The varied educational styles tested included: flipped classrooms with light board videos, real project discussions / decompositions with solstice pods displays, enhanced white boards with projected digital images, mini-team design charrettes on smartboards, and traditional chalk lecturing as a baseline. These techniques are being explored to deepen student comprehension of why and how building structural steel systems are the way they are. It was hypothesized that by developing active strategies coupled with technology will better that engage and heighten student-learning outcomes over more traditional methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of these methods, descriptive and statistical methods will be employed through pre-and post-surveys and interviews along with grade performance correlation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the use of a flipped classroom pedagogy to lower the repeat rate in a bottleneck upper division mechanical engineering course. over two quarters (Winter 2017 and Spring 2017), two sections of the fluid mechanics course were taught back-to-back by the same instructor at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona; one section was flipped (n = 63), and the other was taught in a traditional lecture style (n = 64). Both sections met twice-a-week for 75 minutes. In the flipped classroom, the course material was divided into weekly modules with each module focusing on a different topic. Students completed the following activities for each module: (a) Prior to the first in-class meeting, students were required to watch a series of videos totaling approximately 15-60 minutes; (b) At the first in-class meeting, students were given a concept quiz to ensure they watched the videos, and the remaining class time was dedicated to reviewing the solutions to the quiz, reviewing the concepts in the videos, and solving example problems; (c) After the first in-class meeting, students were provided with an optional zero-credit practice quiz to prepare them for a second, more challenging quiz at the beginning of the second in-class meeting; (d) After taking the challenging quiz and reviewing the solutions during the second meeting, the remaining class time was dedicated to an active learning exercise called a "Team Battle" in which students competed in teams to complete problems as quickly as possible. Students in the traditional lecture classroom also had access to the videos, but were not required to watch them; class time consisted of students hearing lectures on new material and discussing example problems. Both sections were assigned readings and homework problems through the McGraw-Hill Connect platform as a prior study [1] demonstrated its potential benefit in boosting student performance in the course. The impact of the flipped classroom pedagogy on students' academic performance and attitudes was assessed by comparing the flipped and traditional lecture sections' performance on similar quizzes and exams, Connect assignments, concept inventories, psycho-social scales, and focus groups. Students in the flipped class had a much lower repeat rate (D and F combined = 11.1%) than the control group (34.4%). Though individual assignments and exams tended to not reflect statistically significant differences, overall course scores were significant even when controlling for major, GPA in major, and overall GPA. Significant differences in positive changes in psychosocial variables between the traditional lecture and flipped groups highlighted possible explanations for differences in overall course performance, as the flipped group reported greater confidence, feeling more supported and successful, and rated the course more positively. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper evaluates the effectiveness of an engineering leadership development course under two formats: regular lecture and a flipped classroom. Flipped classrooms are designed to incorporate cognitivist and constructivist learning strategies into the classroom environment. Cognitivist-learning strategies build knowledge through internal processing of information while constructivist-learning strategies build knowledge through experiences. The objective of this study was to determine if a flipped classroom is associated with an increase in student self-rating of professional and leadership skills and perceived learning outcomes. Pre- and post-course survey data were collected in an engineering leadership principles course across nine semesters. The first five semesters (n=170) were structured as standard courses with lecture material and in-class activities, a cognitivist approach. The final four semesters (n=152) were structured with a flipped classroom approach. Students accessed course material through weekly online modules and class time was spent in reflective discussion and experiences based on the material offered online, a constructivist approach. The survey included 55 items that covered seven sub-scales: understanding of ethical issues, global awareness (world view), communication skills, organization/leadership skills, self-knowledge, creativity, and teamwork. Only student paired (pre and post) data were used in the analyses in this study. Most survey items had a significant increase from pre to post course survey response in the desired direction. To evaluate whether differences exist between the standard classroom and the flipped classroom, difference scores were calculated for each individual and a Mann-Whitney test, for group differences, was performed on the difference score with males and females combined and within each gender separately. Two items showed significantly higher difference scores in the standard classroom: 'I can explain at least one ethical framework' (p=0.038) and 'I can apply a professional code of ethics to analyze an ethical problem' (p=0.0003). The second item was also significant in the male and female individual analyses. In females, two survey items indicated significantly higher difference scores in the flipped classroom: 'I am confident taking on leadership roles on projects' (p=0.052) and 'I understand my leadership style' (p=0.018). These differences may be reflected in the differences between knowledge and emotional domains. Explaining and applying ethical frameworks are more in line with a knowledge domain, associated with cognitivist learning theories, whereas being confident in one's leadership ability and understanding one's own leadership style may be more related to emotional domains and a result of the constructivist approach to learning through the flipped classroom approach. Several additional trends were noted in the female difference score data that may be more evident with increased statistical power. Preliminary data indicate that the revised flipped classroom may be more effective than the standard classroom in developing student's emotional intelligence. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A novel approach to teaching core Mechanical Engineering courses is presented. The approach combines the Flipped Classroom method with Visual Thinking Strategy. It exploits the powerful aspects of Flipped Classroom, including interactive and engaged problem-solving sessions, while avoiding its pitfalls, in particular the main students' complaint which is the elimination of interaction with the instructor while encountering the material for the first time. This combined approach was developed using step-by-step feedback and active guidance from Mechanical Engineering students and was devised to fit their needs and expectations in learning, retaining, and applying the material. The technique was tested using two parallel sections of Mechanics of Materials, one using the proposed technique and the other the traditional lecture method as control section. The effectiveness of the two teaching approaches were compared using common exam problems evaluated with the same rubric. The paper provides the details of the proposed technique, supporting background in neuroscience of learning, sample pre-class exercises, and a narrative of constructive classroom conversation from one of the sessions. The result showed enhancement of student engagement and participation, facilitation of learning, and favorable student feedback. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Does the presentation style of an information literacy assignment affect students' use of scholarly and authoritative sources in the completion of an engineering design project? During spring semester 2017, the information literacy team at the Colorado School of Mines piloted a flipped lesson on evaluating sources for the university's first year engineering design course. Initial feedback on the pilot session was favorable and the team analyzed detailed data to determine if students retained the needed information on evaluating sources through the semester. Student work, specifically bibliographies from team design proposals and final reports, was used to evaluate if changing the style of the information literacy session positively impacted students' use of scholarly and authoritative sources throughout the semester. The "Evaluating Sources" lesson for fall 2016, modeled on previous years, was comprised of a traditional, one-shot session with an activity in the classroom with librarians. Incorporating feedback from teaching faculty, the instruction team piloted a flipped approach for the spring 2017 lesson. The new lesson required design teams to review videos and other information online, take an online quiz, and then meet in person with a librarian. During the course of one week, 93 student teams met with one of 7 librarians. Teams were prompted to bring questions about scholarly and authoritative sources for their specific problem statement. The meeting also provided the opportunity for students to discuss their initial design ideas and brainstorm sources with a librarian. This paper describes the rubric used for evaluation of the student bibliographies and the results of the study. It also discusses the lessons learned from flipping a single class session and aspects to consider when flipping information literacy content. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the 2013-14 academic year, we embarked on an effort to flip two engineering courses in our department - a year-1 problem solving and programming course (YIPS), and a year-3 numerical methods course (Y3NM). Initially, the Y3NM course, which we were also teaching for the first time and revising significantly as we did, was conducted in a standard flipped model wherein students viewed video lectures and took diagnostic quizzes prior to attending class, and where class time itself focused on discussion and problem solving. In contrast, based on our significant prior experiences teaching the YIPS course, and upon its organization as a mixed-mode lecture/problems solving course, we did not take a standard flipped approach to it. Instead, in the YIPS course, students watched videos during the class periods themselves; such a structure was facilitated by the classroom having one computer per student, to accommodate the programming portion of the class. We refer to this "watch in class" model as a hybrid-flipped classroom, and have found this approach to work significantly better in terms of student engagement and learning than the standard flipped model did for us. With that experience, we modified the Y3NM class to the hybrid-flipped model in subsequent offerings. We recognize that the hybrid-flipped model is resource intensive because it requires far more classroom technology than traditional lecture, and also that our positive results are in part due to the computer-intensive nature of both courses in which we have implemented this model. We report here about our experiences, both positive and negative, with flipped and hybrid-flipped approaches, and provide guidance for instructors considering such changes themselves. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In an effort to develop an entrepreneurial mindset in all our engineering and computer science students, the University of New Haven is embedding entrepreneurial concepts throughout the 4-year curricula in their majors. This is done with the use of several short e-learning modules developed by content experts. The modules are integrated into engineering and computer science courses by faculty who reinforce concepts through a related activity, project, or assignment. The e-learning modules, available online through course management systems, are self-paced and targeted at conceptual learning of 18 specific entrepreneurial topics. Using a flipped-classroom instructional model, students complete the modules outside of class, typically over a set two-week period, and instructors engage the students in discussion either in-class or online and through an activity. This mode of integration enables the assessment of higher cognitive understanding of the concepts and students' ability to apply what they learn. At present, 12 modules have been developed. In addition to the modules being integrated within the University, they have also been adopted by faculty at 42 other institutions across the country over the past three years. The broad-scale deployment has provided assessment and feedback data regarding the effectiveness of integrating the modules into existing courses using a blended approach (face-to-face and online learning). Whereas prior work relied on indirect assessment using pre/post student surveys to quantify the acquisition of knowledge from the e-learning modules and contextual activities, the current work employs student deliverables that are directly assessed by instructors. Faculty were provided assessment rubrics based on criteria aligned with the learning outcomes of the e-learning modules. Direct assessment is tangible, visible and measurable, and provides more compelling evidence of student learning. In this paper we propose an Entrepreneurial Mindset Learning Index to map and quantify the progress of students toward attaining an entrepreneurial mindset. The criteria in the assessment rubrics for the e-learning modules were mapped to the learning outcomes associated with an entrepreneurial mindset proposed by the Kern Entrepreneurial Engineering Network's (KEEN) framework. The KEEN framework is based on the premise that an entrepreneurial mindset is characterized by a persistent curiosity of all things, the skills to make connections between seemingly unrelated things, and an ever-present goal to create value. Through the mapping, the direct assessment results provided an indication of how well students taking courses with integrated e-learning modules achieved elements of an entrepreneurial mindset. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Student-centered teaching employs active learning strategies that engage students in ways that meet their individual learning needs. When adapting from a teaching-centered pedagogy to a student-centered pedagogy, faculty must also make changes to the assessment strategies they use; student-centered teaching requires student-centered assessment. In addition to summative assessment that measures student learning and knowledge through traditional products such as exams, quizzes and papers, formative assessment evaluates the process of learning, and the experience of the individual student. Understanding this student experience can be extremely valuable to both the student and the faculty member, particularly when using a teaching strategy that is new to both. This paper describes a qualitative action research project to learn about the student course experience and help the faculty improve the course. This project methodology uses a simple and efficient formative approach that incorporates strategic and continuous open-ended survey questions in optional feedback assignments to gauge the student experience across the course. Data were collected in the course learning management system (LMS) for multiple sections in a freshman Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering (first circuits) course using a flipped pedagogy across four years and with three different instructors. These assessments focused on identifying challenges to learning, or "Muddiest Points" and student perceptions about classroom strategies and general learning/academic concerns. Simply asking "What can I do to help you learn better? What can you do to learn better?" helped students reflect on their learning behaviors, and in many cases, improved their experience throughout the course. This strategy provided an opportunity for students to take more responsibility for their learning and voice their feedback about the course. The assessments also helped the faculty member improve the course in real time. With this approach, the instructor also identified a number of learning bottlenecks, where a significant number of students were having problems. This very simple formative assessment strategy proved to be a powerful tool for creating a student-centered course. Findings from this study included providing the instructors: (1) a transparent map of the student learning processes; (2) evidence of changing perceptions about the flipped classroom across the course; (3) confirmation of the value of faculty student centered approaches; and (4) the revelation of lessons learned by reflecting students. Recommendations from students will also be discussed. It should be noted that this paper focuses on the student experience in what was generally their first flipped class, and (because they were freshmen) also one of their first college classes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

These differences caused problems with instructor expectations and student capabilities in the second course of a two-course engineering graphics series. Discussion between the course coordinator, faculty teaching the graphics courses, and the administration resulted in the implementation of PTC's Precision LMS in a partially flipped classroom environment that would require students to complete tutorials on the basic functions of the Creo software outside of lab time. Then during lab, instead of focusing on the mechanics of which buttons to click, more time was spent on demonstrations and in-class work that focused on creating effective models, implementing design intent, and using course-specific standard files and formats. Data is being collected and analyzed to assess not only the outcomes of the first engineering graphics course, but also the CAD related capabilities and knowledge of students at the point they are beginning the second course. Initial results indicate a statistically significant improvement in grades on the final CAD project in the first course when compared to semesters where the on-line instruction was not used. A pretest has been developed for implementation in the second course, consisting of questions specifically related to CAD skills and course-specific formats and standards. Results from a limited implementation indicate a majority of students earned a passing grade on the quiz. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Statics Modeling Kit is a low cost and flexible modeling system designed to support active learning in engineering statics. The kit consists of a physical model representative of a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system constructed from plastic pegboard panels along with a collection of components that students use to build, manipulate and analyze models of textbook-style homework problems. Student groups use the kit to explore statics concepts through a series of exercises that connect typical mechanics analysis tasks such as sketching free-body diagrams, mathematical manipulations in vector notation, and numeric computations to physical representations that students can explore to develop their conceptual knowledge. The pedagogy underlying these activities applies the theory of representational competence to provide learning experiences that target conceptual understanding within a problem-solving context. The design of the kit renders most dimensions and select force types readily apparent by inspection, allowing students to focus their time and mental effort on interpretation, application of relevant statics concepts, and analysis. Modeling activities in this flipped classroom implementation support the majority of statics topics including vector operations, concurrent force systems, moments, equivalent systems, support models, rigid-body equilibrium, and friction, all with an emphasis on three-dimensional geometries. Student feedback on the modeling exercises indicates that the models and associated curriculum provide an engaging context for group discussion and problem solving. Students report their experience with the physical models as supportive of skill development in visualizing vectors, understanding vector notation, and interpreting three-dimensional geometry information communicated by traditional textbook-style problem figures. Many students cite the modeling activities as key to developing their understanding of fundamental statics concepts such as free-body diagrams, moments and support models. Small increases in class time allocation and completion incentives over two successive terms that further leveraged the modeling curriculum as part of the overall course design resulted in significant increases in student survey responses regarding the effectiveness of the activities. Classroom sessions that feature the modeling kit feature lively discussion within student groups and provide numerous teachable moments for the instructor to use a model to demonstrate and explain a key concept or nuance to small groups of students. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This paper presents a peer-to-peer learning platform to facilitate the peer instruction process in the context of flipped classroom. Based on learning feedback provided by individual students, the platform functions to divide a large class into multiple small study groups, within which, students can engage in peer instruction to learn from each other. Meanwhile, the platform will provide instructor with the aggregated, analyzed, and visualized student feedback, which can be used to redesign instruction in classroom. Made possible by the Viterbi iPodia platform at University of Southern California, this platform has been tested based on a technology-enabled international course that was attended by 138 students from 8 global universities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This evidence-based paper describes the transition of a senior-level manufacturing engineering course from a traditional lecture-focused curriculum to a more engaging curriculum based on the research in student-centered learning. Many college courses have a familiar format: students listen to lectures, read textbooks, complete assignments, and demonstrate their learning through exams. Often, the instructor will structure the course for convenience, perhaps creating highly structured PowerPoint presentations and using standardized multiple choice exams to easily grade performance. Students, on the other hand, then structure their learning practices to match - trying to determine exactly how much to come to class, read, and memorize, with the end goal of regurgitating information on the exam and getting a satisfactory grade in the course. These practices are not conducive to long-term retention and application by the students, nor to accurate assessment or facilitation of learning by the instructor. But unless both the instructor and the students in a course understand and are amenable to alternative techniques, the format is unlikely to change. There has been extensive research on techniques aimed to increase student engagement in the classroom, such as "flipping the classroom" and identifying and overcoming the "illusion of learning." This paper describes the efforts of the author over three semesters to incorporate these tools into a senior-level course on manufacturing system design and lean manufacturing to help facilitate better learning and assess proficiency more effectively. Several techniques are used, including suggestions from the recent book Make It Stick by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel. Student feedback and instructor observations are discussed, and future recommendations for the course are given. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This complete Evidence-based Practice paper will detail the implementation of scaffolding to support learning in a flipped-classroom environment. Promoting problem solving skill development is a major focus of the General Engineering (GE) Program at Clemson University, as problem solving is a critical skill required by practicing engineers. The GE Program has utilized a SCALE-UP (Student-Centered Activities for Large-Enrollment Undergraduate Programs) environment for over a decade. SCALE-UP is a highly collaborative, hands-on classroom format where the primary emphasis is on learning by guided inquiry rather than by traditional lecturing. The SCALE-UP learning environments is a natural "semi-flipped" classroom by the nature of the program. When used within a large enrollment program that utilizes several instructors in a single semester, the amount of "flip" will vary with each instructor providing various levels of lecture and activities. The largest hurdle with using a "flipped" environment is getting the students to prepare adequately for class to allow for meaningful classroom discussion. The first course in the GE sequence is composed of more than 90% first time freshman, most of whom have yet to develop a mental model of what preparing for a college course entails. In Fall 2015, the first-year sequence adopted the (PREP)ARE model to assist students in understanding the expectations for each class. The model was presented in a standard course management system across all sections of our first semester problem solving (aka. ENGR 1) and second semester programming (aka. ENGR 2) courses. Each course was divided into learning modules that build off the knowledge and skills developed in prior modules. For each module, students were instructed to PREP: Preview the material; get Ready for class; Expand their knowledge; and then Prove it by completing the homework. Prior to each exam, students were asked "ARE you ready?" and encouraged to answer this question by Assessing their performance on each module by analyzing mistakes made on assignments and asking questions of the instructor for further clarification; Reviewing any topics not mastered; then taking the Exam. This work will discuss the (PREP)ARE model in detail, giving examples of activities for each stage to illustrate the breadth of applicability to first-year course material. Examination results, student/instructor attitudes, and course DFW rates will be compared between courses using this method to prior courses. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In a meta-study of STEM courses, use of active learning over traditional lecturing indicated an increase of 0.47 standard deviations on exams and concept inventories. One pedagogy that uses active learning is the flipped classroom, where the initial exposure to the content is obtained outside the classroom via videos, text, online discussion, and assessment. During class time, active learning techniques such as peer-to-peer instruction and solving of applied problems are used. In a prior NSF grant involving a combined dataset from three engineering schools, the authors found that the differences in the cognitive and affective outcomes for blended and flipped formats in a numerical methods course were not statistically significant. The effect sizes measured via Cohen's d were also negligible to small for these two outcomes. One of the known challenges with the flipped format is the pre-class expectations for the students. Currently for pre-class learning in most flipped courses, instructors assign lecture videos or reading assignments. To ensure that such assignments are done, they are either followed by an online quiz or an in-class quiz at the start of class. However, this approach is the same for all students and does not address the differential needs of students. To improve the quality of the pre-class activities for his numerical methods flipped classroom, the second author developed adaptive lessons using the Smart Sparrow platform under a current NSF grant. By doing so, students had a personalized path for preparation that involved multiple representations such as lecture videos, text, questions, and simulations. The students' learning was assessed in real time, and depending on their responses, they were taken on alternate paths in the lesson. An analysis of the various metrics available to the instructor from the Smart Sparrow platform demonstrated that the students were actively using the platform. We implemented these adaptive pre-class lessons in the fall 2017 and spring 2018 semesters and discuss preliminary results from the fall 2017 semester in this paper. The results compare three methods - 1) blended instruction 2) flipped instruction without adaptive lessons and 3) flipped instruction with adaptive lessons. The comparisons are based on direct assessment of learning (i.e., final examination), as well as indirect assessments (i.e., student surveys and focus groups). © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Traditional lecture style courses use class time to deliver new material to students and homework to provide practice. Flipped classrooms, on the other hand, provide new material outside of class and students are then given opportunities to work actively on problems during class time. A flipped classroom design combines active, problem-based learning activities with direct instruction methods, and is seen by many as a teaching method that results in higher student satisfaction, greater retention of knowledge, and increased depth of knowledge [1]. The initial implementation of a flipped classroom can be difficult for teachers. Time is needed to develop instructional materials for students to view outside of class, in addition to the time required for developing constructive in-class activities. Teachers who have persisted with this teaching method often report that their classrooms are not optimized until the third or fourth implementation. This paper describes the three-year progression from traditional lecture style to flipped classroom design of a large enrollment differential equations course at the University of Louisville's J. B. Speed School of Engineering. The discussion section of the paper reflects on specific implementation difficulties of flipping a classroom, and gives strategic suggestions for instructors who are beginning to design this type of curriculum. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The flipped class, wherein students typically encounter new content outside the classroom with an opportunity to explore it deeper in the classroom, is becoming an increasingly popular format of teaching in engineering. since the flipped class typically results in increased availability of instructor created/curated resources for use outside the class and provides greater opportunity for receiving tailored assistance in the class, one would expect students to perform far better when classes are flipped. However, studies have shown that students generally do not perform much better (if at all) in flipped classes, but that students appreciate the increased resources available to them. Although the resources and help exist, it is possible that students simply do not know the best way to incorporate them into their studies. With the eventual aim of helping students better interact with the new resources available to them (pre-class lecture videos in this case), this study aims to understand their current viewing behavior by analyzing video viewing data collected from multiple sections of a sophomore-level engineering statics course. The dataset consisting of 69 students viewing 89 pre-class videos assigned thrice a week over 17 weeks indicates that, on an average, approximately three quarters of videos were viewed to any extent before class, and when viewed, videos were viewed to approximately three quarters of their duration before class. Coverage of each video as well as number of full viewings dropped over the semester, longer videos were watched to a lesser extent than shorter videos, and day of the week had a significant effect on viewing metrics. Video viewing was unaffected by gender and pre-class GPA, and there was no correlation between video viewing metrics and course performance. Hypotheses for differences between the above and previously published trends are discussed with suggestions for improving engagement in pre-class videos. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Results show a very high percentage of students watch the video before class, most students watch in close proximity to the campus (based on IP address analysis), within one/two days before the class. Some students re-review sections of videos before tests, and use multiple mobile and desktop devices that at times shift during the semester.

	abstract = {Senior level courses in engineering curriculum typically require multiple prerequisites from the years earlier. This paper discusses how we solve the challenge in teaching a biomechanics course offered to senior Mechanical Engineering students. The course is designed to teach students how to apply mechanical engineering knowledge in the biomedical field. It covers a wide range of topics and is built on five prerequisite courses. Students take these courses from sophomore through senior years but not necessarily following the same technical sequence. Given this situation, it is critical to make sure students have mastered the foundational knowledge and skills before transferring them to the biomedical context. Traditionally, in each unit of the course the instructor would need about two to three weeks just to review the relevant prerequisite knowledge. This means there is less time left to discuss class examples or advanced topics in bioengineering. To make the review process more efficient, in fall 2016, the instructor adopted a "flipped review" approach by replacing classroom review with a series of review video and quiz combos outside of class. Each combo consisted of one video focused on one technical area followed by an online quiz. They were assigned to students across the semester to support unit-specific topics where the technical knowledge would be needed. All video and quiz combos were due before the class meeting time. Based on positive student feedback, the review series was revised when the course was offered again in spring 2018. This paper will discuss the effectiveness of "flipped review" by using review videos to reactivate student prior knowledge. Student feedback used in this paper came primarily from spring 2018. The must-have features suggested by students, and instructor reflection on how to make the review videos effective, will also be shared. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom has been introduced to promote collaborative learning and higherorder learning objectives. In contrast to the traditional classroom, the flipped classroom has students watch prerecorded lecture videos before coming to class, and the classroom becomes the place to work through problems, advance concepts, and engage in collaborative learning. In this paper, the active flipped learning was applied in engineering mechanics class to combine flipped classroom with active learning to establish an active flipped learning (AFL) model, aiming to promote active learning. Eighty sophomore engineering students, most of whom are African-American students, participated the active flipped learning. To compare the effect of AFL, the traditional teaching was applied in the first half semester and pre- and post-tests were used to evaluate their learning performance. After the mid-term exams, five flipped modules were applied to five topics. All of the students attended these flipped modules. During each of the flipped models, students watched lecture videos before class and conducted a quiz after the video as well as raised and discussed unclear questions in the course management system CANVAS. The instructor analyzed the students' quiz results and developed the in-class exercises. In the lecture time, the instructor focused on the subjects that were problems to students from their quiz results and questions raised after group discussion. Then the instructor used question sets for group activities and discussions. The student group discussion was led by the assigned group leaders. Pre- and post-tests were conducted for the AFL. The survey results were analyzed to compare students' learning engagement, empowerment, self-efficacy, and satisfaction between the traditional classroom and with the AFL. It was found that the AFL model, by taking advantage of advanced technology, is a convenient and professional avenue for engineering students to strengthen their academic confidence and self-efficacy in Engineering Mechanics by actively participating in learning and fostering their deep understanding of engineering statics and dynamics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Russian higher education institutions' tradition of teaching large-enrolled classes is impairing student striving for individual prominence, one-upmanship, and hopes for originality. Intending to converting these drawbacks into benefits, a Project-Centred Education Model (PCEM) has been introduced to deliver Computational Mathematics and Information Science courses. The model combines a Frontal Competitive Approach and a Project-Driven Learning (PDL) framework. The PDL framework has been developed by stating and solving three design problems: (i) enhance the diversity of project assignments on specific computation methods algorithmic approaches, (ii) balance similarity and dissimilarity of the project assignments, and (iii) develop a software assessment tool suitable for evaluating the technological maturity of students' project deliverables and thus reducing instructor's workload and possible overlook. The positive experience accumulated over 15 years shows that implementing the PCEM keeps students motivated to strive for success in rising to higher levels of their computational and software engineering skills.

In this paper, we designed and compared two flipped engineering classrooms, one involving only engineering students who worked on individual design tasks, and the other including groups of an engineering student and an art major student that performed design tasks collaboratively. Fifty-one engineering students, 29 from the individual flipped classroom and 22 from the interdisciplinary flipped classroom participated in the study. During the semester, all students studied pre-recorded video lectures and homework before the class and then participated in weekly engineering design activities either individually or in a group. Students’ motivational experiences and engineering design achievement were assessed at the end of the semester. The results showed that students’ preferences in employing motivational regulation between the two flipped classrooms were different. Also, the students participated in the interdisciplinary flipped classroom exhibited higher aesthetic design achievement. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Background: Elementary courses in engineering schools are conventional and foundational, and involve a considerable amount of knowledge. Throughout such courses, students are also expected to develop insight, which cannot be obtained by only listening to instructors. Having relevant discussions is also difficult for most instructors. Intended Outcomes: The combined use of flipped learning and inquiry-based learning would be beneficial to broaden student achievement. Application Design: Based on an epistemological approach about knowledge and knowing, this paper applies the combined use of flipped learning and inquiry-based learning to enhance student knowledge and advance ways of thinking on a System Modeling and Control course. Findings: The extended learning time and the collective responsibility for learning are discussed as critical issues in applying the combined use of flipped learning and inquiry-based learning in an engineering school. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper will discuss the transition from a lecture-based multidisciplinary introductory engineering course to a revised version that integrates theory and hands-on practice around a theme of underwater robotics, including discussion of the design, implementation, and evaluation of the revised course. The course is required for all students (including non-engineering majors) at a small liberal arts college and is the first engineering course for the majority of enrollees. Final grades in the original lecture-based course showed a gender disparity in which male students outperformed female students that had persisted over the course of many offerings. By employing best practices in engineering education, with a special focus on inclusive teaching practices, the course was revised to a model that includes active learning (flipped classroom) tutorials and hands-on practicums. Students attend two tutorial sessions and one hands-on practicum session each week. Before the first tutorial session each week, students watch videos created by the instructors. Students take individual and team quizzes (following the procedure used in Team-Based Learning), which provide accountability for learning the course material. With the remaining time in the first tutorial of the week and the entirety of the second tutorial of the week, students work in small groups with significant student-instructor interaction on context-rich problems focused on real-world engineering applications. The students then take part in a 2.5-hour practicum session where they interacted with physical manifestations of the course content, largely focused around an underwater robot. For example, in one practicum the students placed their robot in a water tank with a buoyancy “spring” attached, then introduced a step input in motor force and measured the robot's step response; they then used the output data to find the robot's damping ratio and natural frequency. Mastery of course content was measured in both the original lecture-based course and the revised course via a pre/post content test; other evaluation measures included a pre/post attitudinal survey regarding the usefulness of class content, intent to major in engineering, and understanding of the engineering profession and student evaluations of teaching. The results show a significant increase in learning and affective gains for all students. Furthermore, the gender disparity in final course grades has disappeared in the revised course and there is no difference between the performance of male and female students on the pre/post content test. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {How to develop the programming skills in students is a big concern for most of the programming-teachers. Since programming involves higher order thinking skills, teachers use many teaching strategies to develop higher thinking skills in students. Flipped classroom is one such innovative method for achieving the same. The objective of this study was to teach programming in Java to the underachievers using the flipped classroom method and the high achievers using the traditional approach and to examine how the low achievers perform in programming with respect to the high achievers after undergoing the flipped classroom sessions. The study participants were the 4th semester students in B. Tech. Computer Science (2015 admission at Cochin University College of Engineering Kuttanadu, Kerala, India). They had a lab in data structures using Java and Java was not taught in the class as part of the syllabus. Hence, the students find it difficult to do the data structures lab, which motivated the authors to teach them Java as evening classes. The students were asked to rate their programming skills as either good, average, poor or very poor. Based on their feedback and their previous semester marks in programming in C++, they were classified either as underachievers or high achievers. The total duration of this extra class was fixed as ten hours for each group. After the fifth and tenth classes, same tests were conducted for both the groups and the results were analyzed using t-test. The results showed that the low achievers in the flipped classroom performed at par with the high achievers of the traditional classroom. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In-class time is focused more on discussions and practices such as exercises and projects. Flipped classroom was introduced to Mechanical Engineering students in Mechanics of Materials course in 2016 academic year at Mahasarakham University, Thailand. The course was still taught in traditional way and series of video lecture were used as additional class materials outside classroom. There were 2 groups of students that enrolled in the course in 2 different semesters. Students in 1<sup>st</sup> semester were taught in traditional way (control group) and students in 2<sup>nd</sup> semester were used flipped classroom (experiment group). Students' grades between 2 groups were compared and analyzed. Satisfaction survey of using flipped classroom was carried out and evaluated. There were 3 aspects of evaluation which were content, varieties of activity, and functions. Results showed that the course's GPA of experiment group was 1.92 which was greater than the control group of 1.68. The greatly reduction of failed students in experiment group was noticeable. The percentages of failed students of control and experiment groups were 17% and 6%. Satisfaction survey evaluation results showed that the students satisfied in high level in every aspect. The comments pointed out that flipped classroom were easy to use and promoted self-study outside classroom. Those qualities would help students develop more skills in lifelong learning and learning to learn. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The notable remark about any listing of top universities is that more than 60% of these universities are located in the G8 countries with GDP of more than 60% of the world total. This fact confirms that economic growth is strictly tied to social and cultural development, which is linked to the intellectual and scientific development presented by higher education. This also reveals that the answer to the concern of reforming engineering education is YES. Thus, teaching paradigms must change to fit needs and modes of today’s students; they are not interested in passive learning. Active learning must be the path for today’s generation of ubiquitous-learning. Different innovative teaching techniques for highlevel structural engineering courses have been adopted by the author and proved to be rewarding. Among these paradigms are blended learning and flipped classes, which stretch the utilization of technology in classes. Other new techniques such as studentgenerated examinations, student-generated classes, design competitions and projectbased learning are reflection of student-centered education. Here, the said innovative paradigms, which were recently applied by the authors will be presented. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the relationship between student participation and performance in an online flipped course in nuclear reactor modelling is analyzed. In this course set-up, students follow pre-recorded (asynchronous) lectures on the internet before attending on-line (synchronous) sessions twice a week during a seven-week period. Two types of on-line sessions are organized: tutorials and wrap-up sessions. Attendance at these sessions is not compulsory. The tutorials aim at helping the students solve home assignments (on which the students are assessed), whereas the wrap-up sessions are structured around active student participation in the form of discussions. A cross-correlation analysis between results on the home assignments and attendance at the asynchronous pre-recorded lectures or the synchronous tutorials revealed no significant correlation. There is, however, a significant correlation between results on the home assignments and participation in the synchronous wrap-up sessions. This suggests that the wrap-up sessions help students to develop higher order thinking skills. This study highlights the importance of in-class active learning in a flipped classroom format, even if in the present case the in-class activities were organized on-line. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

According to the Horizon Report, which focuses on exploring and reporting emerging technology in education, the flipped classroom has been highlighted as an emerging technology for higher education which is very important to use at the college level (Johnson, Adams Becker, Estrada, & Freeman, 2014).A flipped classroom, as its name suggests, is a class where the lecture and homework have been reversed. The direct instruction given to students as homework can take the form of a video, an article, a book, a power point, a handout, or a combination of these and the class time which is normally spent lecturing, is used for in-class activities such as discussions, problems, and group projects. Replacing direct instruction (the explicit scripted presentation or delivery of information or a task) from the class time with video lectures observed outside of the classroom allows for more class-time to be used for active learning.One of the most compelling reasons for the adoption of flipped classrooms has been poor language competence even after spending many years in ESL classes being simply a passive listener, especially due to disproportionate teacher-to-student ratio and the one-size-fits-all method of education. Flipped classroom rectifies this challenge to make learning balanced—in theory as well as in practice. This Flipped Classroom Approach is chosen to be the thrust area of this paper as it has the prospective to prove that how the creation of a piece of communication goes beyond traditional features such as simply learning the grammar and syntax in ESL classes. In this way, the paper gives the overview of the Flipped Classroom Approach which has been adopted as a language teaching pedagogy in Mepco Schlenk Engineering College and explores its potential with the experimental study having two groups (one as Focused and the other as Controlled) to enhance the communicative competence in English among engineering students. The investigation is limited to any two randomly selected I year engineering branches of Mepco Schlenk Engineering College, Sivakasi. The quantitative data collection and analysis involved random sampling technique and the assessments included the posttest scores of the selected students. The SPSS analysis software tool was utilized to evaluate the quantitative data and to compare the scores. For the qualitative data analysis, the researcher collected Students’ Perception Survey through a Google Form questionnaire which consolidated the students’ review of the effect of Flipped Classroom Approach. The results clearly indicate that students have a preference over this Flipped Classroom Approach and that this approach proved to contribute a lot to their communicative experience as well as there was a relatively better performance on post test scores of focused than the controlled ones. It is hoped that the results of this study will ultimately lead to better understanding of technology use in teaching-learning activities and to deeper understanding of Flipped Classroom Approach. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {MOOCs have made it possible not only to provide quality open education for any learner worldwide, but also to rethink the way on-campus teaching is delivered. The materials produced for a MOOC can be consumed by on-campus students before arriving to the classroom, using class time to do activities that promote active learning, following this way a flipped classroom strategy. This paper presents the experience of redesigning a first-year engineering course with a large number of students (over 400 each year), in which MOOCs are reused, and a flipped classroom strategy is implemented, dedicating most of traditional lecture time to do hands-on, interactive activities. The results show an increase in students’ motivation, both in the use of MOOC content outside the classroom, and in the realization of hands-on, interactive activities inside the classroom. In relation to the teacher, having information on students’ previous work outside the classroom, and on students’ work in the hands-on, interactive activities carried out inside the classroom, allows understanding better the differences between groups, tailoring the explanations during class time, and providing proper reinforcement activities to be done after class. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

From 1999 to 2013, approximately 20-25 students graduated from the program each year, but since 2014 there have been over 100 beginning the junior year. In addition, the faculty have observed that students' attention spans, on average, have decreased, in agreement with literature assessments. After giving the Effective Teaching Workshop at Thiagarajar College of Engineering in 2016, the classroom protocol of the Industrial Chemical Calculations Course was modified to include watching the lectures on video prior to the class.Not giving lectures during the class period allowed more time in class to have students practice solving problems. The result has been an increase in student participation in class even with the large number of students, as well as an increase in the achievement of student learning outcomes.

The main motivation of this paper is to incorporate student engagement techniques such as blended learning and flipped classroom using technology and assessing the students understanding while teaching courses in Electronics & communication engineering and program. Teaching courses using Chalk and Board method are less effective because there is no way to know whether the students are listening to the class and understanding the course. The paper describes the use of EDMODO platform to blend learning where students and teacher can have online discussion. Teacher can upload the video or document and post the assignments and see the graph of student progress. To flip the class by recording power point slides and recording desktop screen. These tools are helpful for students in understanding theory as well as practicals. The result of students understanding is also presented in this paper from which a teacher can know the students' needs to improve in which part of the course. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom has been introduced to promote collaborative learning and higher-order learning objectives. In contrast to the traditional classroom, the flipped classroom has students watch prerecorded lecture videos before coming to class and then ''class becomes the place to work through problems, advance concepts, and engage in collaborative learning''. In this paper, the active flipped learning was applied in engineering mechanics class to combine flipped classroom with active learning in order to establish an active flipped learning (AFL) model, aiming to promote active learning. Eighty sophomores engineering students, most of whom are African-American students, participated the active flipped learning. To compare the effect of AFL, the traditional teaching was applied in the first half semester and pre- and post-tests were used to evaluate their learning performance. After the mid-term exams, five flipped models were applied to five topics. All of the students attended these flipped models. Pre- and post-tests were conducted for the AFL. The survey results were analyzed to compare students' learning self-efficacy and satisfaction between the traditional and the active flipped classroom. Compared to the traditional classroom, students' learning motivation is obviously enhanced in the AFL classroom, with students' interest, curiosity and learning initiatives in curriculum promoted, intrinsic goal orientation further strengthened, in which students tend to have less extrinsic goal orientation and lower test anxiety than the students in the traditional classroom, but with improved control beliefs and self-efficacy for learning. In the traditional classroom, students use more rehearsal and elaboration strategies, while in the flipped classroom, students use more organization strategies and prefer to use critical thinking strategies to raise relative questions about teaching content and video materials. Students in the AFL model use more strategies of resource management, such as time and study environment, effort regulation, peer learning, and help seeking than in the traditional model. In comparison of different student groups, the AFL model effectively improves students' motivation in both long and short learning time groups, but the effects are not obvious on the low GPA students. From the perspective of gender, the AFL model helps to increase the male students' learning motivation, while female students use more learning strategies in task value, control belief and self efficacy in traditional model. Therefore, the instructors should pay more attention in improving the learning motivation and effectiveness of low GPA group and female students in the flipped classroom. In summary, the AFL model, by taking advantage of advanced technology, is a convenient and professional avenue for engineering students to strengthen their academic confidence and self-efficacy in Engineering Mechanics by actively participating in learning and fostering their deep understanding of engineering statics and dynamics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As demand for engineers grows, emphasis is increasingly placed on introductory engineering courses to engage, educate, and retain students. Team-Based Learning (TBL) is a pedagogy that shifts instruction from a lecture-based paradigm to a structured learning sequence that includes individual preparation outside of class followed by active, in-class problem-solving exercises completed by student teams. As part of the individual preparation, students may watch recorded videos of lectures, often at an accelerated speed. While the acceleration of videos has the potential to increase students' learning efficiency, the impact on comprehension is unclear. Two studies were conducted to understand students' viewing habits of video lectures, and to determine whether video acceleration and training can increase students' learning efficiency without significant loss in comprehension. A preliminary study surveyed university students from an introductory engineering course on Decision Support Systems and Computer Programming about their lecture video viewing habits, and found that a sizable subset of students watch videos at an accelerated rate. The main study placed students in one of three groups that practiced watching videos at 1X (n = 16), 2X (n = 16), and 3X speed (n = 15), and then tested comprehension at 3X. Results from the preliminary survey revealed that approximately 30% of the students watched the preparatory videos at accelerated speeds in their introductory engineering course. Results from the main study showed that participants were able to accelerate videos up to 2X and with practice, able to maintain the same comprehension levels as participants watching at normal (1X) speed, whose comprehension levels decreased over time. However, 3X acceleration lowered comprehension, regardless of practice at higher speeds. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Critical thinking, problem solving and design that requires a lot of scientific and technical knowledge dominate chemical engineering courses, as well as the other engineering. However, these skills are failed in most of courses mainly for specific topics like crowded classroom, absence of professor/student contact and motivation, professor as the main protagonist of learning. To provide the desired above skills necessary for success in the chemical engineering fields, several pedagogical approaches can be used in order to avoid the cited problems. Flipped classroom is the methodology that reverses the logical of classroom. Student’s access theoretical content at home and in the classroom take the time to discuss the subject, solve problems and projects with the teacher’s help. In flipped classroom, the live class lectures are replaced by on-line videos or research or reading at home. Therefore, the classroom becomes a dynamic and interactive learning environment. The student turn into the protagonist of learning. In this way, the use of the flipped classroom was evaluated for the first time in the Mass Balance classes of Chemical Engineering Course at Federal University of Ceará, Brazil. The aim our study was to examine the effectiveness of the flipped classroom in learning basic concepts about mass balance. So, we prepared videos about the content, containing the basic concepts, examples of application and resolution of exercises. At home, the students also answer on-line quizzes containing theoretical questions about classes. In the classroom, the students used the time to solve problems and projects guided by the teacher. To measure the complete understanding of the subject-matter learning, we promote an exam based on the mass balance problems typical of chemical engineering process. The obtained results demonstrate that active learning flipped classroom promoted a better understanding of the content, with consolidation of the basic concepts, besides reducing the time needed to understand the subject addressed in the classes as compared with traditional classes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In this context, the concept of blended learning and, more specifically, the flipped-classroom were applied Chemical Process Principles (basically, Mass and Energy Balance) and Mass Transfer Phenomena (Transport Phenomena III), respectively, in the undergraduate course of Chemical Engineering of the Federal University of Ceará. In the Mass Transfer Phenomena class, theoretical lecture and extra class activities were carried, such as on-line quizzes, on-line games, and project design apparatus for measuring properties. In Chemical Process Principles, flipped-classroom approach was used to teach mass balance. In addition, screencast videos online, on-line quizzes, on-line games, as well as teacher-led problem solving were employed during the course. In all cases, the use of technological resources, such as on-line video distribution tools, quizzes and games were useful for the involvement of the students, as well as for the consolidation of theoretical concepts.

Eric Mazur, that support to defines UNISAL Lorena model. The model´s vision was focused on student assessment with different grades for individual and team evaluations in 2015 and 2016. This was made from data by success and difficulties in methodologies implementation and proposal to a new assessment model integrating at least two methodologies: TBL – Team Based Learning and Peer Instruction, applied in 2017. The active learning methods have a big variation according each implementation and approaches for different teams as solution problems, spreadsheet or tutorials for class, individual answers systems with or without pairs instructions in class environment or flipped classroom or new environment (Freeman, Scott, 2014). As well, the new proposal to make students learning and apply concepts working with projects and prototypes get a new way to work capabilities and skills required Market for today.

There are studies that identified that Economics is one of the least popular disciplines due to the complexity of materials and the uninteresting long lectures. This paper shows a successful experience in teaching Economics to engineering students. A question guided this study: How can flipped classroom strategy influence the motivation to pre-class study, the perception of learning and the development of soft skills in the context of Economic classes to engineering students? An online questionnaire was answered by 23% of the students that took classes of Economics at a Brazilian university in the first semester of 2017. Considering the analyzed data: a) 75% of the students engaged in the pre-class activities; b) 81% of the students said that they felt themselves responsible for their own learning and c) 96% said that the professor was effective to direct the learning process. It was asked what motivated them to pre-class study: a) 86% said yes to the teacher´s orientation, b) 81% said yes to pre-class concept tests, c) 70% said yes to seminars and d) 67% to pre-class available material. About the aspects that facilitated the understanding of the content: a) 95% said yes to the pre-class available material, b) 91% said yes to in class activities, c) 88% said yes to the teacher´s orientation, d) 73% said yes to the preparation of seminars and e) 70% said yes to colleagues interaction and seminars presentation. Besides that, 91% of the students declared that this method improved the quality of their learning. Yet, 73% percent of the students said that their soft skills were developed (eg. communication, teamwork, autonomy and creativity). This study shows that the flipped classroom approach engages students turning a non technical discipline into an interesting journey. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Gamification and flipped classrooms are popular concepts in the educational sector, especially in engineering education. We introduced the gamified student response system Kahoot! to a flipped undergraduate computer science course on object-oriented design. The 25 students took part in interactive quizzes during class. Data was collected from nine quizzes consisting of 227 questions, six surveys, as well as a final course feedback. The students experienced a higher learning effect, were more motivated, would like to have more face-to-face lessons with a quiz, and were overall satisfied with the quizzes. A significant correlation between quiz performance and grades on the exam, which tested higher-level competencies, was proven. The grades for the exercises and the exam showed a direct relationship in a homogenous linear regression. The overall course feedback and grades were improved. Evidence therefore suggests that gamified student response systems may improve student engagement, motivation, and learning effect in flipped classrooms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flipped classroom is a student-centered methodology that can help engineering students to acquire the cross-curricular skills demanded by society. However, its effectiveness relies on the commitment of both instructors and students. In particular, this strategy requires students to work on a number of proposed activities before face-to-face classes. Then, in order to follow the most appropriate path in those classes, instructors need a reliable way to know at which degree their students worked on those proposed activities, what issues they encountered while doing them and which concepts need to be reinforced in class. This paper presents a case study of a flipped-classroom undergraduate engineering course. By using data-driven learning design and learning analytics techniques we show that: (1) by delaying their work on the course activities our students actually drove the course towards the traditional approach; (2) despite directly asking students at the beginning of a face-to-face class might seem to be an appropriate way of getting reliable information about their previous work, it may lead instructors to erroneous conclusions; (3) our students were strongly mark- and deadline-oriented, but even a small grade encouraged them to work on the assignments; (4) the gathering and checking of students’ learning data before the class can help instructors to tailor the lesson design; and (5) if students did not work on pre-class activities, dedicating a small amount of time of the in-class lesson to explain the most difficult concepts can help students to be more efficient with their work, at the cost of losing some of the spirit of the flipped classroom. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

For a good teacher, the success depends upon many principal fundamentals and creating an adaptive learning environment for his students to acquire knowledge. It has been reflected during teaching one of the course in College of Engineering at Prince Sultan University, Riyadh that the students were not comfortable with the theory lectures whereas they feel comfortable while playing with number, meaning that their engagement in numerical problems. Flipped Class Room (FCR) and Task Based Approach (TBA) have been used for this research. It has been observed that motivating the students to read the topic in advance as a flipped classroom approach has produce satisfactory results whereas group task project as TBA approach significantly produced even better results for the identified problem. It has been concluded that Task Based Approach (TBA) should be promoted and applied for subject contains theory.

	abstract = {Inspired by Simon Sinek’s TED Talk, “How Great Leaders Inspire Action” (2009) and Carol Dweck’s Mindset (2006), George Couros’s book, The Innovator’s Mindset (2015) builds idea of a “flipped classroom”. Couros’s thinking resonated with an American engineer, partnering with a seasoned language teacher. The routine class, Academic English, required for all third year Electrical/Electronic Engineering students presents a context for creative improvisation. We are “flipping” the classroom. Standard Academic English is simple. Right? The true case is that is not a simple matter at all. Too much vocabulary for too long a time period is stultifying and hypnotic. A 90-minute class once each week is not the best setting, either. The problem is how to teach a substantial amount of technical vocabulary to a large number of Japanese “false beginners,” who have studied English since age twelve, yet who evidently do not wish to speak or be seen to understand spoken English. This situation led to the experimental “flipped” classroom, in which homework is done outside of the class while class time is devoted to laboratory/workshop activities in teams. The investigator roles are Professor and Language Facilitator (Principle Investigator). In this work, we set up the experiment of a new vocabulary learning strategy (VLS), “flipped classroom” combined with Middle-Up-Down2 management style and the SECI3 model of dynamic knowledge creation. Via an intensive 15-week course, students are being immersed in an international-style conference setting, where they must regularly participate in mini-poster presentations on various technical topics. Our research shows that the topic of vocabulary learning strategies (VLSs4) focused on evaluating the efficacies of existing techniques rather than creating new techniques. Furthermore, previous VLS studies largely aimed at word recall rather than on context mastery. In this study, we specifically ask if the use of e-VLS comprised of mini-poster sessions and centered on a core set of engineering vocabulary can have a significant impact on English listening and speaking skills. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recent technical and infrastructural developments posit flipped (or inverted) classroom approaches ripe for exploration at all levels of formal education. Flipped classroom approaches have students use technology to access lectures and other instructional-oriented resources outside the classroom, in order to engage them in active learning during in-class time. Scholars and educators have reported a variety of outcomes of a flipped approach to teaching and learning; however, the lack of a summary from these empirical studies prevents stakeholders from having a clear view of the benefits and challenges of this teaching strategy. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a review of the flipped classroom approach in order to summarize the findings and guide future studies. Thirty-seven peer-reviewed articles were collected from a systematic literature search and analyzed based on a categorization of their main elements. The results of this survey show the direction of flipped classroom research during recent years and the most common technologies, subject domains, evaluation methods, and pedagogical designs; in addition, our study summarizes the benefits and challenges of adopting a flipped approach in the classroom. Suggestions for future research include: describing in detail the flipped approach, performing controlled experiments, and triangulating data from diverse sources. These future research efforts will allow us to better indicate which aspects and ingredients of a flipped classroom work better and under which circumstances and student groups. The findings will ultimately allow us to form best practices and a unified framework for guiding/assisting educators who want to adopt this teaching style. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A first year introductory internet and digital media module, taught as an in- and out-service across two Schools and covering a wide range of music courses, resulted in attendance and completion problems on a yearly basis. Students ranged from technical/programmers through to musicians and performers. Keeping them all engaged, motivated and appreciative of the learning materials was a challenge. The Flipped Classroom approach of front-loading weekly learning materials on to the VLE and providing more time for structured tutorial and computer lab work provided a distinct improvement in student marks and satisfaction scores. This Chapter assesses student marks against attendance and VLE engagement from this approach over one academic year. The learning materials provided a broad richness of weekly-themed resources including: screencasts; text; PowerPoint slides; screencasts of slideshows; scholarly articles; blog posts; web articles; and embedded YouTube videos. Students were encouraged to read broadly and assimilate as much as possible from the varying formats of presentation whilst having weekly structured tutorial content. The weekly content creation/linkages were designed to provide additional materials for those on the technical spectrum and additional content for the creatives. Student marks are compared against attendance and also against VLE engagement over the year. Whilst both indicate a benefit with increasing attendance and VLE engagement, there is a greater parity with the latter—attendance in class is less important than perusing the weekly resources. Students were able to perform to first class standards whilst engaging fully with the VLE and having a less-than 50% attendance in class. A broad section of students engaged with materials before the weekly lab sessions and some engaged with hardly any tutorial work at all. VLE access data also shows many students engaged to the early hours of the morning. The Flipped Classroom approach resulted in better module results as well as an improved classroom experience: greater focus on the learning materials and tutorial exercises; much less time surfing and social networking in class; and more time in class for one-to-one assistance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Classroom instruction in the 21st century needs to incorporate innovative, research-based pedagogies. The engineering classroom is currently experiencing a shift towards more active learning activities due to both advances in educational research, and advances in technologies that enable practices such as the flipped classroom model. Given that course transformation is a gradual process that begins at the level of the instructor, educators need access to the essential tools and training in order to introduce these changes into the curricula. This paper introduces a course re-design based on Self-Determination Theory and Constructivism; and outlines effectively implemented active learning strategies using the flipped classroom model. The data were collected from a Numerical Analysis course, which is an important course across several engineering disciplines at Universidad EAFIT. This course enables engineering students to solve complex problems using mathematical and computational methods. This paper describes the implementation of an online active learning platform called "Numérico Interactivo" for two related engineering courses: Numerical Analysis (NA) and Numerical Processes (NP). The platform was available to all students, but only NA implemented it using a flipped classroom model. NP made the platform available as an optional course tool. Informed by SDT principles, "Numérico Interactivo" includes a variety of instructional materials such as explanations, examples, frequently asked questions (FAQ), self-assessment tools, and evaluation. This study compares the two courses in terms of: (1) students' perceptions about the instructional materials of the course; (2) students' use of the platform; and (3) students' perceived usefulness of the different elements within the platform. Results suggest that students in the NA course found the classroom sessions and the homework assignments more useful as compared to the students enrolled in the NP course. In addition, in the NA course students used the platform more often for class preparation and to study before each module. The way in which the platform was implemented in NA also increased student motivation in the course. Overall, the results suggest that "Numérico Interactivo" is useful to implement course re-designs into engineering and computing education courses, but such tools need to be guided by active learning practices so that students can fully benefit from them. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Psychological safety (PS) refers to the shared belief that a team environment is safe for taking interpersonal risks (i.e., it is ok to be wrong or assert new ideas). PS has been shown to improve the cohesiveness of co-workers and improve group problem solving in various situations. In the flipped classroom model of instruction students watch video lectures before coming to class, then participate in structured learning activies during class meeting times. In flipped classes that use small group or team based learning activities during class, which many do, students' level of PS, willing to ask questions, make mistakes, and address new ideas for a topic without fear of negative feedback from peers, might be an important factor in their experience of the flipped class. For this paper, we collected self-report data from students enrolled in a flipped section of Calculus III. Students were asked to answer validated survey questions about PS to assess their current level of PS at different times in the course. We used this data to assess students' PS at the beginning of a flipped class, and examine whether PS changes over the course of the semester in a flipped class. The results of this study will inform educators about how PS builds in the team environment within a flipped classroom of Calculus III. Additionally, the findings of this study may highlight ways that some of the disadvantages to PS in the flipped classroom can be addressed so that they are not a detriment to student success. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It was recognized that a well-structured flipped learning model to help the students engage in this novel learning model needed to be developed. Including the potential benefits of the before-class learning tasks via using the flipped learning portfolio management system, and the in-class learning activities via the interactive assessment platform. In order to arrange sufficient time to fully engage with the two-stage learning system and in-class activities, traditional lectures were revised and the classroom format was flipped. After analyzing the students learning portfolio for six weeks, it was found that students need at least three weeks to cultivate the habit of watching videos in the before-class stage. Moreover, the students who watched videos more often showed better learning achievements in the formative and summative assessments. The findings further indicated that 80% of the students liked the videos developed by the teacher rather than those on the Internet. The students also showed positive attitudes toward the flipped learning model integrating those technologies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It was found that the time required to generate the video clips were at least 3 times the resulting clip lengths. While the equipment, and operational cost could be kept down, investment in a good video editing software was necessary. The most important factor for success was the determination to push through the entire course despite the workload. Gained lessons included not being too ambitious or aiming for perfection; acceptable quality videos were enough. For clip deployment, the communication with students was also needed. The initial worry about students' accessibility to video clips and online platforms was not found to be of much concern. However, the learning mobility of students was hampered by the internet connection speed and the need for a suitable self-studying environment; the most preferred location and time were at home in the evenings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, mobile technology has undergone an explosion and changed educational contexts. From out-of-class to in-class, the mobile technology provides high portability and mobility to facilitate teachers and students who develop mobile learning in various educational environments. In the mobile learning environment, the mobile technology can assist teachers and students in minimizing constraints of time and place and connecting real-world and digital-world resources effectively. In recent years, to facilitate the development of students' thinking, flipped classroom is an important pedagogy that reverses in-class and out-of- class learning activities in traditional classroom. In the flipped classroom, the unidirectional delivery of teacher's instruction in the traditional classroom is changed to deploy digital learning materials on the web and students can self-learn the instruction before participating the course. Moreover, the assignment of homework and practice out of class is changed to conduct in the classroom and the teachers and students can have sufficient interactions and discussions with regard to the assignment to facilitate thinking skills during the course session. As mentioned above, it is applicable to apply mobile technology to support the flipped classroom. In practice, the mobile technology has been widely applied to support out-of-class learning in the flipped classroom. However, it is rare to concern how to apply the mobile technology to support in-class learning in the flipped classroom. In this chapter, a cross-platform learning and diagnosis web application was developed to support a software engineering course in the flipped classroom. Moreover, a study was administered to investigate the effects on students' learning motivation and performance with regard to the use of the mobile technology in the flipped classroom-based software engineering course. The investigated results revealed that applying the mobile technology to support the software engineering course in the flipped classroom that is helpful to students in enhancing learning motivation and performance. In addition, most students showed favorable perception towards the usage of the proposed application. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

According to a flipped classroom model, new online material in the form of webcasts was proposed to students before class. Students reacted very positively to the webcasts: the percentage of students viewing the webcast before planned workshop sessions ranged between 80% and 92% over the five weeks of the intervention. Enhanced engagement led also to increased attendance (85–92% at workshop sessions), and remarkable active participation in class (half of observed teams were ∼80% active). Remarkably, team performance as quantified by their report marks linearly correlated with the level of active participation in class. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the implementation and results from combining a specific flipped classroom technique with a competency-based learning approach. Results from the analysis of student performance on selected course objectives indicate improved student motivation to attempt the course objectives. Significant difference was also observed in the percentage of students that were able to successfully complete the selected course objectives. Strengths of this teaching method include greater overall student satisfaction with in-class assistance and competency-based assessment. Results also suggest an impact on mid-level and low achieving students leading to a higher overall class performance. Criticisms suggest simplification or emphasis on the workings of the system from time to time. The effect of this course delivery on different assessment formats is discussed, with recommendations on the type of assessments that are best suited for this method. Based on the analysis of the data collected, modifications for future offerings of the course are discussed. Overall, results suggest that a combination of competency-based assessment and flipped classroom approach is more effective in a first-year hands-on engineering design course than each of these individual styles of course delivery. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Using part of the class time to perform quiz group activities proved to be a major enabler to actively involve students in the learning process. The results achieved in the flipped part strongly confirm a much higher engagement and participation level from students in theoretical classes. Moreover, the flipping approach promotes students to continuously study along the semester. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The "flipped classroom" approach provides framework for placing more of the responsibility for foundational learning as part of a student's "homework" responsibility prior to the class meeting, thus freeing class and lab time for more active learning toward deeper application, critical thinking, and other higher-order learning. One barrier to flipped-classroom approaches has been the amount of time required for an instructor to developing adequate support for student learning outside of class. The Mechanical Engineering Technology program at Kansas State University Polytechnic is in its second year of drawing from online modules from Tooling U-SME, originally developed for technician-level learning of manufacturing technologies, to support foundational learning outside of the engineering technology classroom, as well as to assure student exposure to industry-standard manufacturing content competencies. Tooling U course modules were mapped across the freshman and sophomore engineering technology curriculum to coincide with the two-year student subscription. Additional SME (formerly Society of Manufacturing Engineers) media library resources, included with the student subscription, fill in additional curriculum needs or depth. First-steps implementation issues include justification of student subscription cost, instructor decisions about student credit for Tooling U assignments, selection and integration of Tooling U content with additional university course activities and curriculum, and instructor or program administration of the online Tooling U course module assignments. Results of three semesters of first-steps use of Tooling U with freshman manufacturing processes and CNC students provides a case study for application possibilities, lessons learned, and future opportunities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As part of a cost-savings initiative, an existing course of 'introduction to environmental engineering' offered using a 'traditional' format of didactic class meetings supplemented with hands-on laboratory sessions, was changed significantly. The 'modified' format uses 'blended', 'flipped', and 'mastery' approaches to teach "2601: Fundamentals of Environmental Engineering" to approximately 60 sophomores pursuing baccalaureate degrees in environmental, civil, or architectural engineering, each semester. This paper presents a summary of the results from eight course offerings over a period of four years to more than 450 total students. Assessments included student grades; open-ended invitations for anonymous feedback at the end of each semester; anonymous, online surveys at a mid-point and at the end of each semester; the results of a common quiz administered in the first week of a follow-up course on water and wastewater treatment; and in-depth, qualitative feedback from a selection of high-performing students collected during face-to-face interviews during a follow-up course of independent, undergraduate research. In brief, a portion of didactic class meetings was replaced with prerecorded, online digital lectures providing students with an opportunity for asynchronous, self-paced learning. The remaining twelve, 'required' face-to-face, inductive learning sessions promoted improved learning in the cognitive domain and introduced learning in the affective domain. A flipped-classroom coupled with a modified approach to mastery-learning 'required' students to review instructional content before meeting face-to-face including: a) reading the textbook; b) watching pre-recorded, online digital lectures; c) mastering online quizzes; and d) submitting written homework. All students who completed all 'required' assignments before the published deadline were assigned a grade of 'C', for the course. Students who completed additional 'optional' assignments had the potential to earn a grade of 'B' or 'A', for the course. The take home messages for this paper include: (1) a substantial initial investment of time may be needed to create course content using blended, flipped, and mastery pedagogy; (2) group and individual written work, oral presentations, and essays can be used side-by-side with quizzes, a midterm exam, and a final exam to create an 'all-you-care-to-eat buffet approach' to earn grades; (3) implementing a 'one miss' policy for 'required' assignments helps to lower student anxiety over grades; (4) costs were reduced and student learning was maintained through blended, flipped, and mastery pedagogy; (5) many students enjoy the new approach because they appreciate clear expectations and a flexible course format; (6) some students strongly resist the modified format; and (7) a willingness to persevere despite trial-and-error is necessary as students adapt to the new approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Imparting real world experiences is often a challenge due to both lack of effective active learning tools and effective delivery strategies. This pedagogical requirement is important because graduates are expected to develop software that meets rigorous quality standards in functional and application domains with little to no training. Lack of effective active tools has been addressed by the authors by designing, developing, and delivering, twenty (20) delivery hours of Case Studies, sixteen (16) delivery hours of Class Exercises, and six (6) delivery hours of Video Case Studies for use in courses that impart knowledge on SV&V topics viz. requirements engineering, software reviews, configuration management, and software testing. Four key skill areas sought after by employers, namely communication skills, applied knowledge of methods, applied knowledge of tools, and research exposure have been used to drive the development funded by a National Science Foundation grant and perfected through an industry-academia partnership. These tools have been successfully disseminated to over 25 universities with many CS, IS, SE programs incorporating the tools in their existing courses and others designing new courses based on these tools. Since student learning retention depends on knowledge retention activities delivered in different settings it is important to identify and incorporate delivery strategies that meet course and/or module learning outcomes. In this paper we discuss strategies used to effectively incorporate and deliver the developed Active Learning tools by instructors at two universities. Traditional and flipped classroom delivery strategies are discussed as well as topics like pre-requisite knowledge preparation prior to class, course module presentation sequence, homework, team/individual work, collaborative discussions, and assessment tools are deliberated. In addition student feedback and assessment are also presented for each category of active learning tools and strategies that work are summarized. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Electrical engineering students often find microprocessors to be a challenging course since it involves learning to read lengthy datasheets and learning to program at the device level. For two semesters, the Microprocessors course at East Carolina University (ECU) has been taught in a flipped classroom format allowing students to watch online lectures before attending each lecture period and to allow students more opportunities to ask questions and complete learning activities in class. During the scheduled lecture period students are encouraged to work with each other to complete hands-on in-class exercises allowing them to evaluate their understanding of the material presented in the online lecture and the assigned reading. Such in-class exercises may involve answering conceptual questions, writing code, or building circuits. It was observed by the instructor in previous semesters that some students who had a good grasp of course concepts became volunteer student leaders and helped others on their journey to learning course concepts by sharing approaches to solving problems and explaining difficult course concepts to others. It was also observed that some students did not exhibit leadership and relied on lab partners to do much of the work while they were not engaged. Leadership can also go beyond simply helping others, but taking initiative and seeking out assistance, coming prepared for class, learning to delegate responsibilities in a team project, and following through in completing the work expected. Leadership is also demonstrating by recognizing the assets of those in one's team and finding ways to work with others effectively to complete assigned tasks. In the Fall 2016 semester, course leadership was formalized in the Microprocessors course at ECU. Students were encouraged to engage in leadership through coming to class prepared, helping other students learn, and asking questions when they struggled to understand course concepts. Leadership outside of the class was encouraged through the formation of study groups. The instructor also created a Piazza site for the students to use an online forum allowing them to ask questions and to answer each other's questions. Students were surveyed at the midpoint and end of the semester in order to reflect on their own participation in the course and to evaluate the leadership of their lab partner. Students were encouraged to provide constructive feedback in order to help their lab partner improve and to develop a plan for their own leadership development. As part of a funded leadership grant, the instructor kept an online journal of each day's activities and the opportunities students had to engage in leadership through each of these activities. One lab session was also videoed to formalize the observation of student leadership. This video was reviewed and coded to assess the types of interactions the students had with their lab partners, other peers, and the instructor. Various leadership qualities were noted including asking questions when having difficulty, seeking help from other students, seeking help from the instructor, and collaboration in teams. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Most of the graduate aerospace classes are dominated by complex analysis and a plethora of equations. As such, without proper context, it is very easy for a student to lose sight of the big picture, which hinders them from critically thinking about the knowledge they gained and its applicability in the real world. The recent surge of the modern pedagogical practices at the University of Dayton such as student-centered learning, active learning, co-teaching, problem/project based learning, entrepreneurial mindset learning, flipped classroom, etc., are largely focused on undergraduate classes but not in graduate classes comparatively. This paper documents a teaching model where the homework, projects, activities, lectures and independent studies are all integrated on a single platform (portfolio) in an endeavor to motivate graduate students to practice sustainable learning (long-term learning) and promote critical thinking skills. The author implemented this model for the first time in a graduate compressible flow aerodynamics class with the "portfolio" as a platform of integration. The paper also discusses the application of this model in the compressible flow class with examples, students' reflections and feedback. Students found this model to be different and more effective than traditional graduate classes and were able to connect, apply, understand and appreciate the relationship between the complex mathematical equations and the real-life applications. It was also found that creating a portfolio takes more time and effort when compared to traditional exam based class and the workload might need to be reduced. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) teaching strategies that engage students and create an atmosphere of community are desperately needed to recruit, retain, and best prepare students in STEM fields to address challenges facing the 21st Century. Research shows that student performance and persistence in a STEM degree is associated primarily with three aspects of their experience: intellectual engagement and achievement, motivation (e.g., having role models), and identification with a STEM field (e.g., developing meaningful relationships, being part of the community). While there is a large body of work about pedagogies and strategies that address these needs (e.g., active learning, experiential learning, service learning, flipped classrooms, etc.), the majority of university instructors are slow to adopt new teaching strategies. Most STEM faculty were never trained to be teachers, and there are many well documented reasons that faculty are slow to change teaching habits (e.g., (Frederick 1986). According to Sarason and Banbury (2004), "many faculty accept the premises of active learning but do not have adequate tools to bring active learning techniques into the classroom." Games and game-based learning have been used in many classrooms as an active learning strategy. Game-based learning is a well-documented method to engage and motivate students with course material in order to improve student-learning outcomes. One very successful and popular game is Clarkson University's Energy Choices board game. This award-winning board game teaches concepts of energy; research shows that when game play was integrated into the curriculum, this game was shown to increase desired cognitive (e.g., documented improvements to math and science achievement scores) and affective (e.g., student interest and confidence in STEM) outcomes. In addition, the Energy Choices board game is widespread. Using Energy Choices as inspiration, we are developing a framework for integrating game design into civil engineering and construction management curriculum that makes it easier to develop and publish games like Energy Choices. We are developing a set of game design approaches for use in the classroom that promote high levels of student engagement, create a sense of community, improve student metacognition, increase student retention in STEM, all the while being easily transferable and scalable. By involving students in game play and game design, we not only better engage students, we also create community and drive students to higher levels of metacognition. We have also found that following game play with game design easily moves students up the cognitive dimension of Bloom's taxonomy, from merely understanding, to reflection, creation, and evaluation. Board games and role-playing games are formats that create community; students interact with one another over intellectual, enjoyable, and memorable shared experiences. When the co-authors play board games in their classrooms, they note 100% of students in class that day engage in game play - anecdotally, this activity seems to engage more students than other types of active learning strategies. And finally, board games and role-playing games are an ideal format because any faculty or student can easily modify them. This poster presents our project results to date and provides recommendations and resources to adopt game design in civil engineering and construction courses nationwide. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The revision of the junior-level Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing course MFGE3316 was driven by three forces: ABET, keeping current on an ever-changing software program, and fostering classroom discussion. At an ABET outcomes annual review, the consensus opinion was that the students could effectively design but they needed more practice to better recognize the concepts of engineering design theory. This weakness led to a push for students to practice more with designing and design theory before their senior design courses. Traditionally, MFGE3316 lectured on design theory, fundamentals of CAD/CAM systems, and CNC code generation by CAD/CAM software using a combined class/lab time. The Mastercam software is important for preparing students for industry, but was taking significant classroom time and resources. The revised course pedagogy is a hybrid flipped classroom environment to shift instruction of software use out of the classroom, but the instructor did not have the time or resources to create and continually update video content on how to use Mastercam. Instead, the instructor assigned an "e-text" (SolidProfesor account) for the course. The videos from the e-text are assigned to be watched before coming to class for that topic. During class the instructor does a short overview, leads discussion, and then the students work on the lab. Previously, a significant portion of the lab and class time was devoted to lecturing on software use. This change in pedagogy has allowed more time for in-class discussion and in-class design exercises. As well, the change in presentation style has resulted in more rapid understanding of Mastercam, as evidenced by the semester week in which the class completes the labs. The use of the e-text has also assisted the instructor with keeping class content up-to-date for each new version of the software without having to personally create new videos. The effectiveness of the additional time spent on design theory was assessed with the beginning of semester and end of semester engineering design self-efficacy survey instrument. This instrument was administered to determine if the course and time spent on design had an effect on the students' engineering design self-efficacy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The flipped format, though effective for most students, is not ideal for every student: a pathway is needed for students where English is a foreign language, where social interactions are difficult or impossible, or where thrice-weekly classes are an obstacle. As an attempt to meet that need, an online-only section was taught (sometimes called distance education) using all the materials from the flipped class to help the population of students who who could not enroll in the flipped class for whatever reason. Students had access to short concept videos, example videos, written notes, and hour-long videos of both the flipped class and old lectures. Online quizzes were required as well as TA-graded homework. Results indicate that student performance did not equal that for the flipped class. Furthermore the differences in results were not explained by differences in the demographics of the the student populations except in the nonresident-alien population. While the online-only format using the flipped materials can be a pathway for some students, online-only Statics does not seem to result in similar student outcomes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In the fall semester, the first year faculty member was responsible for teaching two sections of a junior-level, required class: ECE-360/Signals and Systems (3 credits). The class has historically been taught in a traditional lecture format. In the spring semester, the first year faculty member was responsible for teaching two sections of another junior-level, required class: ECE-322/Embedded Microcontrollers (3 credits). The class has historically been taught in a flipped format. First, the first year faculty member's student performance on the ECE-360 (traditional format) and ECE-322 (flipped format) final exams were compared. Our results show that the first year faculty member's student performance moved from a uniform distribution (traditional format) to a truncated normal distribution with a higher mean (flipped format). Second, the first year faculty member's student performance on the two final exams was compared with previous years' student performance. Our results show that the first year faculty member's student performance in ECE-360 (traditional format) were more poorly distributed with a lower mean than previous years. However, in ECE-322 (flipped format) the first year faculty member's student performance distribution and mean were commensurate with performance from previous years. Third, student surveys and faculty interviews were conducted. From our analysis, we find strong quantitative and qualitative evidence that the first year faculty member was more successful teaching in a flipped mode classroom. Additionally, the improvements in student performance seen in the flipped classroom required less preparation on the part of the first year faculty member, leading to higher levels of faculty and student satisfaction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The entrepreneurial mindset in this model is characterized by the Kern Entrepreneurial Engineering Network (KEEN)'s 3C's, which are curiosity, connections and creating value. The core of the model is the integration of short, self-paced, e-learning modules into courses spanning all four years of all engineering and computer science programs. A flipped classroom instructional model is used to integrate the modules into courses. We are in the third year of implementation on campus, and following a pilot deployment of the model at five other institutions in spring 2016, have conducted a large-scale deployment. Six e-learning modules were deployed at 25 institutions across the country during the 2016-17 academic year. We first summarize the integrated e-learning model implemented at the University of New Haven, which follows a clearly defined structure on module and course mappings. This structure, however, is not rigid, and we demonstrate by examples the wide potential for adopting these modules within all engineering disciplines and at all class levels. We also describe the deployment and adoption of these modules at 24 other institutions. We assessed the impact of the modules on student learning using pre and post surveys, and student and instructor feedback. We performed assessment across all institutions where modules were deployed. We also discuss lessons learned during development, and internal and external deployment of the e-learning modules. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flipped classroom model was widely used as an effective method to change the interaction of the students and the instructor during lectures. It allowed the students to go over the lower levels of learning in Bloom's taxonomy (knowledge and understanding) individually and at their own pace. This freed the classroom time to go over higher levels of learning, such as critical thinking, solving and analyzing problems in the classroom which helped foster deep student learning and increased retention of the topics discussed. The setting of large lecture halls discouraged students from participating in classroom activities and allowed them to be passive during lectures. It was not easy for the instructor to differentiate between students who were prepared for class or those who were not, which defeated the objective of the flipped classroom model. By adding online quizzes to the flipped classroom model, the students were encouraged and motivated to do the work as part of the course objectives before coming to class. This increased their participation in classroom activities, thus enhancing their learning experience. In a second year fundamental engineering mechanics course, consisting of about 120 students, individually tailored pathways were designed for students to achieve the learning outcomes of the online modules. Using the graded online quizzes as an integrated part of the flipped resource material available online encouraged the students to go over the material before class. The online quizzes allowed the students multiple attempts and guided them through different resources with each unsuccessful attempt until they got the correct answer. The author conducted an online survey on the effectiveness of the model, and was able to collect successful strategies and challenges to work on. Some of the concerns student had were: more examples in the video resources, the lack of opportunity to ask questions while watching the videos at home, the lack of people to help with the in-class problems,...etc. These were all addressed during the second time the model was used in 2016. For example, to help students with their questions while watching the videos at home, an online platform was developed for the course that allowed students to ask or answer questions anonymously. The instructor closely monitored the discussion to ensure accuracy and completeness of responses. Correct answers were endorsed by the teaching team. 82% of the students participated on the online discussion with an average response time of 33 minutes. This improved approach was received very well by the students. This paper shares the whole experience including design, implementation, work-load, benefits and challenges of the model. The paper also discusses the changes that have been done to the model to address the students' concerns, and the students' feedback during the two rounds this model was used. The different assessment techniques used to evaluate the students' knowledge on the material covered in the flipped classroom models is discussed. A comparison between the grades of cohorts instructed with the proposed model and with the traditional model shows the benefits this model incorporated into students' learning. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Student collaboration should encourage students to teach one another. Thus, course material is cemented in the teacher's mind, and the student being taught also benefits. It is hoped the taught becomes the teacher at another time on other topics. Before this study, the authors used class time in their flipped classrooms for quizzes, which served as formative assessments, and solving practice problems in informal groups. Many studies have shown the benefit of collaboration between students<sup>1</sup> so the authors hoped to increase the amount of collaboration among students by assigning students to groups and quizzing them in these groups at the end of each week. To test the group quizzing hypothesis, in Spring 2016, the authors conducted a study in two different courses, each having two sections, all taught in flipped mode. One section for each course was the control group. Collaboration was encouraged in the control group, but not formalized. In the study sections, after the middle of the semester, groups were chosen by the instructors. The groups worked as teams on practice problems, and took a group quiz at the end of the week. Groups were changed each week. Assessment was by comparing changes in exam performance between the control and study groups and through a survey. Comments in the survey indicated a change in student attitude when assigned to a group. Students revealed a desire to be supportive in their groups, and said they prepared accordingly - an encouraging result. However, less encouraging, students confessed to preparing less for group quizzes, knowing others in their groups would provide what they lacked. Exam scores did not indicate a significant difference between the control groups and the test groups. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Group Learning At Significant Scale (GLASS) approach is developed to increase the scalability and efficacy of student design teams during group sessions of a Flipped Classroom (FC), as well as conventional modality courses. GLASS utilizes freely-available collaboration tools to facilitate instructional delivery, assessment, and review of teams that leverage campus WiFi connectivity, along with a pedagogical approach using excerpts from actual data sheets and open Internet resources. This immersive collaborative design experience is interwoven on a weekly basis with the technical content provided via video during the preceding week. The instructor manages multiple design teams to conduct a weekly Challenge Problem during inclass time. First, students are randomized by the Learning Management System into small groups. Second, a challenge problem is provided, delivered via WiFi-enabled laptops, tablets, or smart phones, forming virtual design teams, regardless of where students are seated. Third, students utilize their WiFi enabled devices to discuss the challenge question via chatroom-style dialog channels alongside a solution whiteboard and/or figure drawing space, while utilizing open resources on the Internet to postulate a solution. Fourth, once the design team concurs that their results are complete, they submit their answers to the Learning Management System (LMS) for auto-grading and score-recording in the grade book. Credit is earned by correctly answering each designated question sub-part, which provides partial credit. Throughout the team design activity, the instructor monitors the assignment progress online in real-time, including windows for each design team showing a solution draft as it is constructed, and providing feedback via each group's designated chat channel. LMS statistics are available in real-time for the autograded answer of the first design team having a correct solution, dubbed the Pioneer Group, which receives a bonus after its group leader presents their solution to the class. GLASS was piloted within a FC-format ECE course titled Computer Organization, with an enrollment of 116 students, and also trialed within the courses Software Engineering and Healthcare Systems Engineering, having enrollments of 140 students each. Results indicate attainment of learning outcomes while making group sessions significantly more tractable for large enrollment courses and bringing useful insights to the instructor while learning is transpiring. Student perceptions indicated that 71%, 70.1%, and 60.3% of respondents agree or strongly agree that the GLASS tools/procedures were sufficiently easy to learn, that group sessions promoted useful interactions with classmates, and that the collaboration mechanisms enhanced abilities to solve engineering problems, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Software is now ubiquitous and software security is now realized as a growing threat. It is important for software developers to fix software security problems, however more imperative is for software developers to understand that security features are not to be introduced as patchwork when a security situation arises but are to be addressed and handled very early in the software development lifecycle. Industry's general lack of ignorance of software security benefits and more importantly the shortage of software practitioners possessing software security understanding creates multitude of problems in the software industry. Imparting real world experiences in the academia as well as the industry is a challenge due to lack of effective active learning tools (ALT). Riding on the success of developing and disseminating, 42 delivery hours of active learning tools in the area of software verification and validation the authors propose to partner with industry to develop 14 delivery hours of course modules developing ALTs in the form of class exercises, case studies, and case study videos and delivering them using a flipped classroom model. Through a gap analysis exercise jointly carried out with industry partners a draft requirements list has being identified. Specific exercises are being developed using an iterative development methodology. Student understanding is proposed to be assessed through quizzes, exams, assignment, and a learning survey. Once developed the ALTs will be made publicly available through a website. This paper discusses continuing work on the gap analysis in software security education, presents proposed contents areas for ALT, shares structures of three developed/proposed ALTs, presents a sample of a survey instrument, and presents a sample ALT on case study video. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This Complete Evidence-based Practice paper will focus on the design, implementation, and evaluation of a multidisciplinary introductory engineering course that integrates theory and hands-on practice around a theme of underwater robotics. The course is required for all students (including non-engineering majors) at a small liberal arts college and is the first engineering course for the majority of enrollees. The previous version of the course was a traditional lecture-based introduction to lumped element modeling of mechanical and electrical systems and modeling of signals using a Fourier analysis approach. The new version of the course covers most of the same technical content, although a Laplace transform approach has replaced the Fourier transform approach and a brief introduction to control theory has been added. Based on best practices in engineering education, the course design and implementation team has moved from the lecture model to a model that includes active learning (flipped classroom) tutorials and hands-on practicums. Students watch videos created by the instructors before the first tutorial session of the week, then come to tutorial to take both individual and team quizzes (similar to Team-Based Learning practices) and work with their teams on a short problem that provides real-world context for the content covered in the videos. The second tutorial session of the week is dedicated to context-rich problem solving with significant interaction between the instructors and students. Following the two tutorial sessions each week, students take part in a 2.5-hour practicum session where they experience the content in a hands-on environment, with most practicums focused on an aspect of the underwater robot. For example, the robot is placed in a water tank with a buoyancy "spring" attached and a chirp signal is input to the thruster to obtain a Bode plot response of the robot's position versus thruster input frequency. Evaluation measures include a pre/post attitudinal survey regarding the usefulness of class content, intent to major in engineering, and understanding of the engineering profession and pre/post content tests from both the previous, lecture-based incarnation of the course, and the new version of the course. Results show significant increases in student learning, affective gains, perceived understanding of the field of engineering, and an erasure of a previous gender gap in course performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Students saturated with theoretical classes are prone to disengagement from the instructor and course material. To increase student engagement and provide an enriched learning environment that combines practical experiences with theoretical knowledge, an alternative approach to a flipped classroom was explored. With a senior and graduate mix of 28 students, roles in the Flight Vehicle Performance (FVP) course were partially flipped, as students were asked to take ownership of their learning through two main efforts. First, integration of the Merlin Flight Simulator early in the course built off of previous use to provide a practical exposure to the course material, even before it was presented in class. Second, the students were required to prepare lectures that cumulatively covered around 25% of the core course material. These methods greatly enlarged the learning platform of the class. Assessment of the lecture assignments was uniquely based on active participation by the students, including the learning process, delivery of the assigned content, and students' ability to keep the audience engaged. Class performance through projects and homework assignments revealed that students enhanced their knowledge of aircraft stability and control through flight simulator experience, iterative homework assignments, and by preparing and presenting assigned lectures. Reflections from the students showed that they greatly benefitted from the intuitive theoretical learning through the use of flight simulator. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Larger classes in a growing program have prompted instructors to seek alternative classroom management techniques while maintaining student-instructor interaction. A revision of a Computer Aided Design (CAD) course was necessary due to annual software updates and an initiative to promote classroom discussion. Early offerings of the CAD course focused on learning how to use SolidWorks in a combined lecture and lab time. The instructor passed on his/her knowledge to the students by lecturing and demonstrating. The instructor could easily move around the classroom and help students as needed in classes with small enrollments. With small class sizes in a new, growing program, instructors did not assign a textbook, but used notes and handouts. A later offering of the course used a textbook, and the instructor used the same approach in the classroom. With growing enrollment requiring full computer labs, the pedagogical approach has shifted the instruction of the software out of the classroom in order to maximize individual student interaction. Without the need to revise notes and handouts for a newer edition of the software, the instructor assigned a series of short instructional video lessons to be watched before coming to class for the day's topic. During class the instructor did a short overview, led discussion, and then allowed students to work on the daily assignment or lab. Previously, a significant portion of the lab and class time was devoted to lecturing on software use. This change in instruction has allowed more time for in-class discussion, student collaboration, and in-class design exercises. The complexity of parts and models created over previous offerings shows that the change in presentation style has resulted in more rapid understanding of SolidWorks. The use of the external tutorials has also assisted the instructor with keeping class content up-to-date for each new version of the software. This paper summarizes the results of revising a traditionally taught course, with notes and handouts, to one that utilized a textbook, and finally into a hybrid flipped classroom model. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, lectures can be divided into two main groups as far as content delivery is concerned. In face-to-face format, instructor delivers the content in the classroom in real time where students are expected to take notes to later refer to the course material when preparing for an exam. In the online format, the content is available as a lecture video and audio recording where the student can watch lectures on their own schedule. While face-to-face lectures have the advantage of enabling a more engaging atmosphere within the classroom, online lectures provide flexibility and archivability. Recently, flipped classrooms have gained in popularity by combining both methods to some extent and in different ways. However, the results reported in the literature so far in terms of student success are mixed. On the other hand, online lectures forego the traditional classroom time for media rich presentations of course material with inconclusive results. While there are other studies in the literature investigating the effects of video lectures on student understanding in traditional classrooms, they don't use recordings of actual classroom lectures. In this work however, face-to-face and online delivery methods are combined in a much more literal way by supporting traditional lectures with online video recordings of the same lectures which significantly reduces the additional teaching load of the instructor. Students are expected to attend face-to-face classes which are recorded and made available to them after the class for easy reference before the exams or to help reinforce difficult to learn topics. To compare changes in student success this study has been done throughout four academic semesters spanning a period of Spring 2014 to Fall 2016 with the same instructor, on a junior level "signals and systems" course for electrical engineers. The control classes had only traditional face-to-face lectures whereas the modified classes had online video support. No other differences existed in terms of course material, grading schemes, assignments, etc. In the end, statistically significant differences are observed in student grades between control sections and those supported with online video recordings. It is the author's opinion that repetition of course material in a way that doesn't affect time-in-class helped improve student success with minimal effort on the instruction side. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom format is becoming increasingly accepted among many engineering schools. By offering traditional lecture material online or outside of the scheduled class time, students are able to spend their interaction time with the instructor on hands-on homework and application activities. Like many undergraduate engineering programs, at the Schulich School of Engineering all first year students are required to take the introductory computer programming course. With course enrollment around 800 students, and the relatively wide variety of students with different programming backgrounds, it would be challenging to provide the students with an in-depth learning experience by relying only on a traditional lecture hall format. A flipped classroom provides students with the opportunity to explore the implementation of theoretical programming concepts previously learned online. After a significant redesign, this course has been run in a flipped classroom format since summer of 2015. Weekly video lecture content is provided through an online learning management system, and students are held accountable through embedded quizzes. Students collaborate on interactive studio exercises both inside and outside of class time, culminating in a final creative design project. Data regarding student performance, assessment, and perceptions has been collected over several semesters and will be analyzed and presented in the final paper. Both quantitative and qualitative measures will be included in a mixed methods study. Student performance in consecutive courses will also be discussed in comparison to previous non-flipped cohorts. This paper will outline the design and implementation over two years for this large-scale flipped introductory programming course, and will provide recommendations to other educators based on experience and lessons learned. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flipped classroom has gained attention in recent years as a teaching method in which the time allocated for introducing new concepts and the time used for practicing them are inverted, in order to provide more time for problem based learning and class interaction under direct supervision of the instructor. The implementation of this teaching method is comprised of two main components, the pre-class activities, which consist of individual student work and are largely based on pre-recorded videos, and in-class activities, which are group activities supervised by the instructor. This paper discusses the implementation of the flipped classroom method in a Fluid Mechanics course in an Engineering Technology program at a midsize university. The study presented was conducted over four consecutive semesters, the data representing four different groups of students. In the study presented, an important percentage of the students took the course in an online setting, either synchronous or asynchronous mode, which created an atypical situation compared to other implementations of flipped classroom method presented in the literature. It was found that the length or the format of the pre-recorded videos were not critical factors in determining the students to review them before the class. The unconventional setting of the class, including both in class and online students, required originality in handling the in-class activities. The best approach was to delegate students to lead the group discussions associated with solving the problems, while the instructor acted as an observer when the discussions were constructive and as a guide when the solution was getting out of rail or when the students were struggling. A survey was distributed to the students at the end of the course as a post-class activity, concluding the implementation considered in the study. The results of the survey showed that the students were satisfied with the teaching method and found it important in their learning process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We use three components to measure student learning namely, final exam scores, competency acquisition and feedback levels. We compare a traditional offering with a flipped offering delivered the following year to a comparable student population, and with no change in the course content and assessments. We observed that in comparison to the traditional, the flipped model increased pass rates in the final exam and also enhanced competency acquisition. In terms of feedback levels, the flipped classroom provided more time for one-to-one in-class personalized feedback. Our approach is unique in the sense that we use a competency framework to be able to pin point the competencies that were improved as a result of the flipped model. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In this context, flipping the classroom is a challenging proposal suggesting the replacement of teacher led instruction with in-class activities for students that focus on higher-level knowledge processes. Aiming to take advantage of the flipped classroom in engaging students in Machine Design, we decided to flip part of the correspondent undergraduate course following specific design principles. In class students worked individually and in groups on several types of problems, participating also in a peer review activity. The pre-course content was consisted of existing material, videos, texts and appropriate URLs. This was delivered through a wiki on the wikispaces platform. Preliminary results of this pilot study provide evidence about the potential of the flipped classroom method for higher engineering education. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There is ample evidence about the positive benefits of active learning, but lecture continues to be the prevailing pedagogy in most undergraduate engineering courses. Conventionally, students' first exposure to course content happens in the classroom, and the main goal of class time is to deliver information. This paper describes one instructor's efforts to flip that convention by shifting first exposure to occur before class, thereby allowing the integration of active learning pedagogies into the class. We hypothesize that two factors will contribute to the success of this 'flipped' classroom: (1) a new digital textbook, which ensures that students prepared meaningfully for class, and (2) a flexible classroom space, which helps to facilitate in-class active learning activities and student-instructor interaction. This paper discusses data, preliminary analyses from one semester, and plans for future work that address these hypotheses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Here we present results of an additional study we conducted to determine whether our earlier results can be replicated if the flipped class is used for the whole course. We extended the use of the flipped class to not only cover programming but also include the course topics of engineering design, project management, statistics, dimensions and conversions, technical representation of data and engineering ethics. We compared student performance on traditional quizzes and lab assessments in the flipped classroom version to data collected from the previous term where only a portion of the course was flipped and an earlier traditional running of the course. Data collected on student usage of learning material, grades and surveys was consistent with previous results. Students were able to adjust to the unfamiliar flipped classroom model, with the majority preparing for the class beforehand using the provided learning materials. The flipped class also resulted in similar improvements in assessment results when compared to previous runnings of the course. Lastly, students here too perceived the flipped class to be beneficial to them from a learning perspective and assisted them in the course outcomes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Several operating systems (such as Windows, Android, and iOS) and (free and commercial) applications were involved in the developing of the resources. The combined use of these tools has allowed us to produce a long list of educational videos, which use several formats to show the contents to the students, avoiding the monotony that may show up during their watching. Specifically, the content of the videos is related to educational material used in a first course of telecommunication engineering, in the matter Computer's Architecture. These videos are used to carry out a blended flipped classroom educational experience over two classes in these course (each with approximately 30 students). We think that the work presented in this paper can be used as a guide by people who want to make videos for their own flipped classrooms (even with the support of our OER videos). © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A within-subjects experiment design approach is used to assess self-efficacy and perception based on learning style preferences. To compare the effectiveness of flipped based (FB) classroom with that of traditional lecture based (LB) approach, selected topics were taught using the two methods. The topic of "learning with technology in special education" was taught using LB method. The FB method was used to teach four topics: Technology tools, hypermedia tools, distance teaching/learning and role of the internet and web-based learning activities on teaching. The learning materials in the flipped teaching method included videos, post-tests and surveys. These were made available online to the students using Blackboard course content. The results show that flipped classroom approach made a statistically significant difference to the self-efficacy. The data analysis also gives insights into students' perception of learning style preferences. A survey of students was conducted to assess their personal perceptions of FB method. The students overwhelmingly favored use of FB teaching strategy compared to the LB approach because it promoted collaboration and hands-on activities during class time. The findings from this study can be used to implement FB teaching approach in other college level technology and engineering courses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This paper focuses on architects as an audience and the teaching of computer science by architects, who successfully applied computer science education research. The author describes the structure and development of a required computational thinking course with an average yearly enrollment of 69 students and how it applied best practices from Media Computation to improve student outcomes and engagement. A four-year impact study found that a flipped classroom model combined with peer learning methods was superior to traditional lectures and labs for improving student performance and reducing attrition. Comparisons of pre-And post-class surveys revealed an improved perception of computing and an increased interest in the subject -A positive outcome for a required introductory course. The author also studied the course's long-Term effects. Three years after taking the course, a majority of students felt they retained what they learned and that learning computational thinking helped them to learn new software and perform better in advanced computing courses. By taking into account how architects learn and revising in response to assessments, we believe our course structure and teaching methodology demonstrates an effective case for applying computer science education research within an architectural curriculum. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is so great and growing significantly in teaching and learning of this 21st Century. The flipped classroom model has grown in popularity as it is the only blended learning model that utilized both in class time and out of class time. There is a need to evaluate the quality of the best flipped learning approach that could enhance students' ICT skills as mastering ICT skill is becoming the key of learning in this 21st century. The ability to educate students for higher order learning using technology does enhance the learning processes as compared to the traditional settings. There are only a few studies conducted on the students taking ICT subject and none have in depth studies in their ICT skills. Therefore, this paper proposed a new flipped classroom model that increases students' ICT skills. The model incorporates the Social Constructivism theory and Flipped Classroom Model that are derived from blended learning. There are also two learning strategies used in this model which is Competency-based Learning and Inquiry-based Learning which helps to enhance students' ICT Problem Solving Skill. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

One group utilized the lecture-based strategy (n = 53), while the other group utilized the flipped classroom (n = 52), (b) an adjusted flipped classroom model was adopted in the midterm of the experimental process, (c) certificate examination and interview were distributed to assess the students' academic achievement. The findings suggest that group activities are usually the goal of the in-class portion of the flipped classroom, however, individual activities can be most beneficial and can be helpful for students who need more individual reflective time to learn. This study blended the individual and group activities into the flipped classroom and got the evidence to support the research questions. The implication of this study and suggestions for future implementations is also discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Due to the emergence of flipped classroom, there have been a shock to the classroom teaching mode. However, the practice and research of flipped classroom were more in primary and secondary schools, rather than in the university. Is the flipped classroom model suitable for college students' learning? What kind of knowledge content is more suitable for flipped classroom teaching? What kind of strategy is more suitable for flipped classroom teaching? This study attempted to answer the above questions. This study employed quasi experimental research method, chose a class of grade three in a university as the research object, and took a science course I taught as a case to carry out the experiment. The researchers selected four groups of modules to carry out four groups of experiments, and each group of experiment included two modules. The content and the difficulty of the two modules were equivalent. The module A was the experimental group which used flipped classroom teaching mode, and the module B was the control group which used traditional classroom teaching mode. In each group, the degree of knowledge of students was measured by the pre-test and post-test. In addition, the study also used the questionnaire survey method, interview method and observation method to collect the student's behavior data and feedback data. The results were as follows: first, the flipped classroom teaching was suitable for undergraduate courses which was higher degree of difficulty. The flipped classroom teaching promoted the students' mastery of knowledge and the application of the method, and also improved the learning initiative and participation. Second, compared with the basic concepts, theoretical principles and other types of knowledge, the flipped classroom teaching was more suitable for these knowledge of method application and complex problem solving. Third, college students had higher requirements for the video quality in the flipped classroom, and video quality might affect the learning interest of college students. Fourth, the design of the problem was very important. The difficulty level of the problem should be moderate to ensure that students could fully discuss. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom as a form of active pedagogy in postsecondary chemistry has been developed during the last 10 years and has been gaining popularity with instructors and students ever since. In the current paradigm in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education, it is widely recognized that active learning has significant positive effects on students' grades. Postsecondary organic chemistry is a difficult course for students, and the traditional way of teaching does not foster students' active involvement. Implementation of active pedagogy could increase students' achievement in this course. However, few quantitative data are available on the impact of active pedagogy in general, or flipped classrooms in particular, on learning in organic chemistry at a postsecondary level. Thus, in this study, we evaluated the gain on final grade scores in organic chemistry after implementing a flipped classroom approach to promote active learning in this course. We encouraged students to be active by having them watch educational videos before each class and then having them work during class time on problems that focused on applying the concepts presented in the videos. Exams were the same as those completed by students in the traditional classrooms of our college. In an a posteriori analysis of our students' grades, we compared final grades in traditional classrooms (control group, N = 66) and in flipped classrooms (experimental group, N = 151). The sample was stratified in three categories depending on students' academic ability in college, from low-achieving to high-achieving students. Our results show that students in the experimental group have significantly higher final grades in organic chemistry than those in the control group, that is, 77% for students in the active classroom vs. 73% in the traditional classroom (p < 0.05). The effect was the greatest for low-achieving students, with final scores of 70% in the active classroom compared with 60% in the traditional one (p < 0.001). This difference in performance is likely due to students spending more time solving problems in a flipped classroom rather than having the questions assigned to them as homework. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The use of smartphones, owned by the students, will engage them in the learning process if the lessons are planned well. This study was conducted to evaluate a flipped learning in a language tutorial class and to examine students’ acceptance and feedback towards the implementation of flipped classroom and the usage of video and smart phone as the right tech tools in the flipped language learning. The results from both survey and individual interviews indicated that most students had positive acceptance towards the flipped language learning approach. This shows a positive impacts for engineering students’ styles of language learning and widened opportunity to prepare and practice using the language before, during and after the class.

It utilizes iBeacon devices, a kind of wireless devices to connect without human intervention, as awareness functions in the learning environment construction. Also, it develops APPs for mobile devices to get students' classroom activity portfolio, and then to keep them in the cloud server of the system. Additionally, Apps offers web links for learning. There are several types of students' classroom activity portfolio including log data of recording students enter/leave classroom, responses to pushing information once students entered classroom, and distances from students' position (seat) in classroom to teacher' presentation location (for example, the front desk of the classroom). The CLAP system can offer analysis results of the classroom activity portfolio. Hence, it can help students who can readily send their records or responses on class in classroom. Moreover, they do not require in typing many data (for example, long URLs) for interacting with the portfolio collection system. Furthermore, the system can assist teachers in collecting students' classroom activity portfolio, and then to have analysis results of the portfolio. For instance, teachers can get the result that students entered classroom but they send less or no feedback in classroom to the cloud server. Experimental results demonstrate the CLAP system has high learning interests while applying it in flipped-classroom learning. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Thus, the traditional process of transmitting knowledge in the teaching-learning system, both in basic education and in higher education, has become obsolete, since the medium that this digital society acquired knowledge, generating knowledge, is the technological support. It is common to check in the classrooms students with no motivation to participate in classes or attentive exclusively to their technological devices, generating a problem for the teacher's performance in the classroom in the process of teaching learning. Thus, new forms of teaching learning should be considered by educators, such as the inclusion of information technology and the realization of classes that are much more practical than theoretical, with real learning experiences and interactive possibilities, as this new network generation requires. Thus, the objective of this article will be to evaluate the differences between the traditional model of knowledge transmission and the flipped classroom model that will be applied to the students of the Production Engineering course at the Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná - Campus Londrina. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

These competencies include problem-solving, communication, leadership, and collaboration, among others. Using a pseudo-experimental design, and employing a variety of data from exam scores, course evaluations, and student assessment of learning gains (SALG) surveys of key competencies, we compared the development of both chemistry content knowledge and transferable or generic skills among students enrolled in two types of large classes: a lecture-based format versus an interactive, constructive, cooperative learning (flipped classroom) format. Controlling for instructor, as well as laboratory and recitation content, students enrolled in the cooperative learning format reported higher learning gains than the control group in essential transferable skills and competency areas at the end of the term, and more growth in these areas over the course of the term. As a result of their work in the class, the two groups of students reported the most significant differences in their gains in the following areas: "interacting productively to solve problems with a diverse group of classmates," "behaving as an effective leader," "behaving as an effective teammate," and "comfort level working with complex ideas." Our findings clearly show that cooperative learning course designs allow students to practice and develop the transferable skills valued by employers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This paper outlines an experimental study that analyzes the effectiveness of flipped classroom design, and argues how the use of technological, educational resources such as videos of educators teaching, interactive materials, simulators, virtual labs and game-based learning have facilitated the use of class time for active learning and discussion. The study was conducted in several academic years with groups studying Fundamentals of Computer Technology, a core subject in the first year of the Computer Engineering and Information Systems degree courses. We analyzed data collected from online activities on a learning platform created from scratch, from classroom activities and from attitudinal and satisfaction surveys. We compared the evolution of outcomes between the 2009-2010 and 2015-2016 academic years. The methodology followed a quantitative design with control and experimental groups, and descriptive statistical techniques were used. The results obtained show that learning achievement and performance in terms of qualifications were higher in the experimental groups, where the flipped classroom approach using technological resources was adopted, than in the control groups, where the traditional lecture approach was used. A significant positive effect on participation, engagement and student satisfaction was also identified. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the results of a case study about the orchestration process of a MOOC-based flipped-class, and the students’ adoption of this teaching practice. The study was conducted on a mandatory third-year course on Organizational Behavior in the School of Engineering at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile with 346 students. The analysis shows that students pay more attention in class and are more participative, even though this means more work and study. Also, implementing this strategy is much more work for the teacher than giving a traditional face-to-face lecture, but the students pay more attention in class and are more participative. Furthermore, up to 96% of the students were active in the MOOC under study before class, especially watching the video-lectures, and students who were more active in the MOOC showed better scores on the course exams than those less active, a difference that proves to be statistically significant. These findings suggest that a MOOC-based flipped class is a good solution to promote student’s motivation and learning, but the implementation of this teaching strategy is delicate and must be very well planned. We provide a list of lessons learned about five key factors to be considered when orchestrating a MOOC-based flipped classroom: design, management, awareness, adaptation and role of actors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Undergraduate engineering programs have a reputation for being rigorous and demanding programs with high attrition rates. Unfortunately, the typical teaching approach that these programs take may impair the training of engineers from diverse backgrounds. These diverse engineers will be required in the future to help solve the grand challenges of the 21st century, but to produce these engineers requires a re-examination of pedagogical approaches in engineering. For the last five years, the innovative IMPULSE (Instilling Mature Problem-solving and Understanding of iLl-defined Scenarios in Engineering) approach has been refined within the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Carleton University. IMPULSE has improved student understanding of engineering concepts, their self-confidence in solving open-ended design problems, and their motivation to remain in engineering. IMPULSE is innovative for engineering because the approach combines a number of pedagogical techniques from other fields to create a novel and enhanced learning experience for engineering students. The combined pedagogical techniques are flipped-classroom instruction from Physics, case studies from Business Administration, Law and Medicine, and classroom discussions from Liberal Arts. IMPULSE has been applied to second and fourth year elective and mandatory courses courses using custom developed YouTube videos, case studies in class, case study based final exams, and group build projects. The key result of IMPULSE is that students have an increased confidence and willingness to accept failure thus they are more capable of handling open-ended, realistic problems and have a better grasp of the concepts of engineering. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Although various approaches to address problem-solving exist, none uses nonlinear, unscaffolded, unstructured, open-ended problems provided by practicing engineers. To address this shortcoming, such authentic engineering problems (AEPs) were incorporated into a heat transfer course. AEPs are authentic problems developed by practicing engineering and are representative of the unstructured, open-ended problems encountered in industry. To make space for students (N = 35) to work on AEPs in class, the course was inverted, meaning that the standard course lecture content was moved online. This AEP Centered Learning (AEPCL) format was assessed by three measures-talk-alouds, student self-evaluations, and solution evaluations. Across all assessments AEPCL led to improved problem solving. Comparisons to the same course taught in a traditional format (N = 32) showed that these improvements came with no cost to students' understanding of the content or loss of ability to solve standard textbook problems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The benefits of the flipped classroom (FC) model in students' learning are claimed in many recent studies. These benefits are typically accounted to the pedagogically efficient use of classroom time for engaging students in active learning. Although there are several relevant studies for the deployment of the FC model in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) subjects, and at Higher Education and/or High School, there are very few works studying FC in social studies and at primary school level. This paper presents an action research focused on the implementation of the FC model in teaching social studies in primary school. The main scope of this action research, conducted over an entire school year with two different History classes (one representing the experimental group that followed the FC model and the other representing the control group following the traditional lecture based approach) was to compare the use of classroom time for student-centered learning activities and the resulted learning outcomes related to both traditional learning goals of a history course (that is, memorization of historical content) and more ambitious ones such as the cultivation of historical thinking skills (HTS). The study revealed that indeed, the classroom based sessions of the experimental group were used for engaging student -centered activities and that this resulted into better learning outcomes in terms of demonstrating critical HTS. Thus, this initial action research provides encouraging evidences for the potential benefits of the FC model in primary school social studies courses. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The emerging Flipped Classroom approach has been widely used to enhance teaching practices in many subject domains and educational levels, reporting promising results for enhancing student learning experiences. However, despite this encouraging body of research, the subject domain of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) teaching at K-12 education has not yet been explicitly researched. This is a considerable shortcoming given (a) the globally acknowledged need to effectively design and deliver ICT curricula to students at all levels of school education (primary, junior and senior secondary) towards cultivation of digital competences, and (b) the recurring research evidence that the Flipped Classroom approach can enhance students' learning experiences in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) K-12 education. Therefore, the contribution of this paper is the design and implementation of an action research for studying the effect of the Flipped Classroom approach in K-12 ICT teaching and learning. The action research employed a quasi-experimental design using experimental-control groups, from two classes (a total of 46 students) for an entire semester of the school year following the National (Greek) Curriculum in junior high school ICT studies. The results of this study provide evidence for potential advantages in students' cognitive learning outcomes related to subject domain knowledge, the exploitation of teaching time during the classroom face-to-face sessions, the students' level of motivation, as well as their level of engagement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The concept of the flipped classroom, where the lecture is moved outside the classroom with the help of technology and learning activities occur inside the classroom, was recently introduced into college-level courses. Such a form of learning is expected to provide an excellent platform for organizing innovative classroom activities in which higher-order cognitive skills for interdisciplinary learning are introduced. However, engineering programs have lagged behind other fields in integrating blended learning into curricula. In this case study, the effectiveness of flipped teaching for civil engineering students in a water resources course was assessed. One section of the course was delivered online and was provided to students before class. In-class activities were designed to promote higher-order cognitive skills. Formative and quantitative assessments were designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the flipped teaching approach. This case study found that students are generally willing to participate in the innovatively flipped teaching approach. In addition to efficiency, this approach led to an improved grasp of concepts and problem solving. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Many University lecturers in Germany face the challenge of teaching very large classes, sometimes including 1000 or even more students. They often have to cope with a very high level of noise, bad room conditions, an extremely low level of participation as well as interaction and feedback. Some lecturers therefore try to overcome these challenges by using technology in their classroom. Previous research has already focused on evaluating the use of audience response systems (ARS) in a traditional but very large engineering lecture. This sort of technology has proven to be an effective tool in order to e.g. increase student motivation, give them additional support in the learning process and on the other hand give the lecturer feedback about the students’ learning progress as well as possible crucial points of the lecture. This paper, however, goes one step further. It analyzes the use of ARS in a flipped classroom setting of a large engineering lecture for first-year-students. After having completed almost two thirds of the flipped classroom lecture, students were being questioned about their experiences and opinions about the use of ARS in this particular educational setting. The standardized questionnaire included questions issuing e.g. comprehension, motivation, frequency, enjoyment, interaction, involvement as well as usability aspects. First results show that e.g. the majority of the students feel that clicker questions foster their comprehension, motivate them to be attentive and increase the quality of the lecture. When comparing the results to findings from previous research in a traditional lecture, however, one thing becomes apparent: The evaluation of the use of ARS in the in a flipped classroom setting has turned out to be slightly less positive than that of the traditional lecture. This finding will be particularly discussed and may even call for further research in the designated field of interest. In a first step, the lecture itself will be described considering content, background and general settings. Subsequently, the survey instrument and methodology will be presented. In a third step, the results of the survey will be presented and discussed. Finally, further research fields will be identified. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

During classes students build active learning, such as problem solving and collaborative work. This paper shows the opinion of students of a numerical analysis course in Industrial Engineering, before and after a flipped class experience. The model of flipped classroom is presented to students–that never had a class in this way–and opinions of what they think about the model are gathered. After that, some issues of the course are tackled in a flipped way. Then, a survey is conducted among students, inquiring about details of their experience. Learning results are also measured, in comparison to other courses with usual classes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flipped classroom is something that more and more teachers add to their teaching plans. To use video recordings of their lectures as a support for the students and then focus more on working with the curriculum in class has become a method that is adopted by an increasing number of lecturers. In higher education the students are adults. This implies that it needs to be a form of lecturing adapted to adults. From the area of organizational learning, and from andragogy, the key to learning lies in motivation and the motivation is triggered by engagement that in its turn stems from involvement. However, involving the learner in their own learning process is also about 'letting go' of the teachers' full control. But is it necessary to maintain control? Is it possible to view the undertaking as a learning experience also for the teacher/lecturer? What control should be executed and what can one let go of? The research done at Hedmark University of Applied Sciences, show some interesting features. The courses have been 'Learning Organizations' (autumn) and 'Knowledge Management' (spring). The lectures have been in the form of streaming video and the course is organized as three full day seminars each semester/course. Each day has had a similar approach: a browse through the different chapters that are going to be discussed. Then follows solving assignments related to the presented topics, first in small groups, then in plenary. Before the lunch break, the students present suggestions towards possible new assignments. During the lunch break, the lecturer writes up the assignment using the input from the students. There is a quality check regarding the topics being within the scope of the seminar. After the lunch break, the students solve the assignment, first in small groups, then in plenary. The assignment and solution(s) are discussed using the following standard: 1. What did we learn from the assignment? 2. What did we learn from making the assignment? 3. Which issues raised in the assignment could be elaborated further, either as a mandatory assignment (fall) or an exam (fall and spring)? It is important to be clear and unambiguous about the learning objective of the course. It is also important to keep the scope within the limitations of the main literature. (This does, however, not exclude added resources like research papers, external links, etc.) Note also that there is a balance between the literature of the curriculum and the way the courses are taught. The course on 'Learning Organizations' includes a section on how adults learn, and thus they are 'convinced' about the method of teaching. The course 'Knowledge Management' has the course 'Learning Organizations' as a prerequisite, so it also 'inherits' the way of lecturing/teaching/learning. This involvement, the students claim, has contributed to enhancing their learning outcomes. The students seem to grow accustomed to the organization and 'expectations' the program. Also the average grades from last fall have improved from an average grade of C to an average grade of B. The activity in the classroom has shifted from the front of the classroom to the whole classroom. A few Observations made during this process are: 1. The students are far more strict than the lecturer 2. The students suggest wider assignments than suggested by lecturer 3. The lecturer receives numerous tips and hints to support creating new assignments 4. Even if it is not 6 hours lecturing, it is a demanding task to secure that the assignments and solutions at all times are within the framework of the learning objective 5. For the second and the third seminar, it is important to seek to include at least parts of the previous literature. The paper will detail the different issues tied to the process of this 'flip' and seek to explain the findings using relevant theory. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we report on our approach and preliminary observations of transitioning to a flipped classroom model of instruction for our first-year undergraduate programming courses. We believe that our situation is rather unique, in that we are doing so in the context of a newly-formed, Western-style university in Central Asia. Before the transition, our introductory programming course (in C), and our data structures course (in Java), were taught in a more traditional lecture-lab setting. Now, all lesson content is contained in online video lectures, which are embedded in our WordPress course pages. In-class time is now spent almost exclusively on students working through programming exercises in pairs, getting help from instructors and teaching assistants as needed. Our primary motivation in moving to a flipped classroom was to allow us to effectively cover material in more depth in our lectures, without sacrificing class time where we wanted students to focus more on hands-on activities. A secondary motivation was to allow us to deliver the course content in a consistent manner across multiple sections, from semester to semester. This has been a challenge given the steadily growing numbers of students in these courses, coupled with the continual additions and changes in faculty members and TAs. As part of our preliminary study, we compared student performance in terms of final exam scores before and after the transition, and collected feedback from students using questionnaires. We did note a slight, though not significant improvement in exam scores. The student feedback was very positive, and indicated a high level of student involvement with the new approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study analyses the effectiveness of teaching an undergraduate process control course in a flipped mode, with a constraint that the students do not have to do more work than in a conventional class. Video lectures delivered by the instructor in the past were used as study material. It was supplemented by classroom and LMS based discussions, a virtual lab, and tutorial sessions. To enforce the watching of video lectures, a weekly quiz was conducted. Assessments were also carried out through three longer forms of quiz, a mid-semester examination and an end-semester examination. The performance of the students was evaluated using the following metrics: (1) Perception analysis of the flipped class students. (2) A limited comparison of the performance of the flipped class students (experimental group) with a similar set of students who underwent a conventional course simultaneously (control group) (3) Studying the consistency of the flipped class students' performance over different evaluation criteria and correlations between them. The results are consistent with each other and the performance is good. An overwhelming majority of the flipped class students (about 80%) also perceive the flipped method to be as effective as or better than the conventional method of teaching. As it helps achieve the benefits of a flipped method, simultaneously with high satisfaction levels, this method can be considered as successful and hence is easily implementable, even in large scale. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Although present work on both video based learning and ipped class- rooms emphasize the necessity for students to view the ma- Terials, there is a lack of detailed, objective data on student viewing behaviors. This article aims to use fine grain student log data from TrACE, an asynchronous media platform, to understand student viewing behaviors in three sections of a ipped CS1 course taught by the same instructor. We find that students often have low compliance with video view- ing expectations in one section, and that re-watching course content does not often occur. Watching course content ear- lier has a significant correlation to course performance, and other behaviours correlate when compliance is not enforced via course requirements. These findings highlight concerns for ipped classroom researchers and suggest methods in- structors can use to improve student viewing behaviors. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A total of 76 video clips (15 hours of running time) were developed and delivered to 41 sophomores (21 females and 20 males) through Youtube in addition to the university's learning management system. The students were asked to preview the lecture contents before each class by watching a pre-class video. For in-class activities, exercise problems were presented to groups of 3-5 students. An instructor and a teaching assistant guided each group to solve problems cooperatively, monitored the students' group activity and answered their questions. At the end of every chapter, the students were asked to evaluate their group work and personal preparedness for the class and also to write a short reflective journal. The muddiest point of each chapter, i.e., the topic posing the most difficulty to students' understanding, was surveyed through Google Forms®. The students liked watching the videos before each class and performing student-centered, in-class group activities but a few limitations were also found and reported. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Engineering graduates who will be leaders in today's rapidly changing environment must possess an entrepreneurial mindset and a variety of professional skills in addition to technical knowledge and skills. An entrepreneurial mindset applies to all aspects of life, beginning with curiosity about our changing world, integrating information from various resources to gain insight, and identifying unexpected opportunities to create value. The Kern Entrepreneurial Engineering Network (KEEN) defines curiosity, connections and creating value as three core components of an entrepreneurial mindset. These 3Cs coupled with associated engineering skills forms KEEN's entrepreneurial mindset framework. An entrepreneurial mindset enables engineers to develop sound technical solutions that address customer needs, are feasible from a business perspective, and have societal benefit. The Tagliatela College of Engineering at the University of New Haven is working to develop an entrepreneurial mindset in its engineering students through a four-faceted framework based on KEEN's constructs that includes: 1) developing an entrepreneurial mindset amongst faculty; 2) providing curricular components that develop specific student knowledge and skills; 3) structuring the physical environment to promote entrepreneurial minded learning; and 4) providing opportunities for students to engage in meaningful extra-curricular activities. This paper focuses on the curricular component of this framework. As part of these curricular activities, 18 short, self-paced, e-learning modules will be developed and integrated into courses spanning all four years across all engineering and computer science disciplines. Each module contains readings, short videos and self-assessment exercises. Five of these e-learning modules were developed in fall 2014, four of these five were piloted in the Spring 2015 semester, and all five modules were broadly deployed in the Fall 2015 semester. A flipped classroom instructional model is used to integrate the modules into courses. Content is delivered via a short online module outside the class, and student learning is improved by reinforcing the content covered in the module through class discussions and contextual activities. Direct and indirect assessment is performed through formative and summative class assessments and module specific pre and post surveys, respectively. The five integrated e-learning modules presented in this paper are: 1) Developing customer awareness and quickly testing concepts through customer engagement, 2) Learning from failure, 3) Cost of production and market conditions, 4) Building, sustaining and leading effective teams and establishing performance goals, and 5) Applying systems thinking to solve complex problems. The first two modules were integrated into freshman classes, the third into a sophomore class, the fourth into third year laboratory courses, and the fifth into senior design courses. This paper describes the learning outcomes and the reinforcement activities conducted in the courses into which they were integrated for two of these modules. The findings of the module specific surveys and the assessment results are also presented. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A junior-year Mechanical Vibrations course with 110 students was "flipped" to increase student engagement and learning outcomes. Each week, a gapped notes handout was created. Theory and derivation videos were generated using open-source software and a tablet PC. A qualitative comprehension quiz was administered using the online course shell through which the students accessed the videos. The homework assignment was posted at the same time as the videos, and was due one week later. During the first of two 75-minute lecture slots, the instructor completed examples related to the video topics. The second lecture slot was for student-directed homework problem solving. As a partial control, the final course module was delivered in the traditional manner. Students reported a strong preference for moving the theory and derivations out of lectures, and an overall preference for the flipped course format. The biggest challenges were 1) instructor's perception of diminished connection to the class through not being physically present for the motivational and explanatory material, 2) finding optimum complexity for worked examples, 3) higher workload to generate content during the first offering, and 4) student perceptions of increased workload. Recommendations include incorporating small worked examples into the videos, to allow for more complex examples to be done live by the instructor for each topic; and for the student-directed problem-solving lectures to be somewhat structured, with 1-2 common homework problems worked simultaneously by all. Additional recommendations for generating flipped course content are given. Overall, the instructor's experience and student feedback confirm that a flipped format is compatible with, and has impact on student engagement in, high-enrollment, mathematically-intensive upper-year engineering courses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Our University's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department has offered an elective course in Electric Machinery for decades. With increasing focus on renewable energy and power electronics in the curriculum, we felt the need to modernize this course so that it provides a better learning experience and appeals to more students. Over a period of two terms, we updated the hardware lab equipment, designed new hardware lab experiments, added new computer modeling experiments, and added power electronics content. This produced excellent student evaluations and good learning outcomes in fall 2013. In fall 2014 we "flipped" the course, with mixed results. Instructor-student interaction did increase, but there was no significant improvement in exam or lab outcomes, and the student evaluations decreased significantly from the non-flipped version in fall 2013. Some students preferred the flipped format, but they were outnumbered by those who did not. We seemed to fix something that wasn't broken. This paper will focus on continuing course format changes to improve both outcomes and student evaluations. Only the successful flipped classroom elements were retained for fall 2015. In the spring 2015 term, 134 video screencast example problems were added to the instructor's teaching of Linear Circuits & Systems 2. The addition of optional video content yielded significant improvements in both outcomes and evaluations, compared to the instructor's previous teaching of Linear Circuits & Systems 1. This suggested use of video content to supplement, but not replace, in-person teaching of new material, as in a blended classroom. Therefore, in the fall 2015 term, Electric Machinery was offered with supplemental video content. The course schedule also changed. The class now meets for two 75-minute lecture periods and one two-hour lab period per week, versus the one-evening-per-week class session in the past. The instructor also incorporated two items from the ASEE National Effective Teaching Institute (NETI-1) summer 2015 offering. The first new element is detailed learning objectives, which are presented as study guides, amounting to six full pages of objectives for the course. The second new element is a "scaffolded" handout for each class, encouraging students to actively complete content and take notes. In addition, the instructor has added animations using the ANSYS Maxwell software that serve as demonstrations for students during the software labs. Students also complete short online quizzes before class to promote preparation. Thus, our fall 2015 class has assumed a blended classroom format, in which face-to-face and technology-enhanced instruction are used together. We evaluated this classroom for the degree of active learning, problem solving, student collaboration, and instructor-to-student interaction using a structured behavioral observation protocol known as the Teaching Dimensions Observation Protocol (TDOP). We compare our observational results between fall 2014 and fall 2015 to formally assess differences in classroom practices. Impacts on student final exam performance and student evaluations are also discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the use of research-proven Active Learning techniques to transform the teaching of a traditional Machine Components/Mechanical Systems Design class. We know from research in Active learning that use of these methods can often lead to greater conceptual understanding and greater engagement of the students with engineering course materials, yet a common concern among engineering faculty is that the adoption of Active learning techniques will not allow the full breadth and depth of traditional content coverage. In this work, the authors reimagined one of the most content-heavy courses in a traditional Mechanical Engineering curriculum by including many Active Learning teaching and learning techniques. In this practice-based research project, the authors attempted to answer the following questions: 1) Could the students learn the breadth and depth of the content via Active Learning, 2) How do the students value the Active Learning experience as compared to a traditional approach and 3) Is the faculty experience such that it would motivate them to use Active Learning techniques in the future? In order to answer these questions, the course was redesigned to eliminate traditional lecturing and the solving of example problems by the instructor. Instead example problems are placed online to be reviewed by the student at their convenience (an element of the Flipped classroom) thus freeing up class time for various Active Learning experiences including conceptual questions, Think-Pair-Share activities, Ranking tasks, individual and team quizzes, and collaborative problem solving. Project Based Learning (PBL) was used through two large team-based design projects undertaken during a weekly laboratory session. A mixed-methods assessment strategy was employed to evaluate the success of these approaches. Quantitative data was obtained from final exam performance for both conceptual understanding and problem solving competency which was compared directly to the same class taught in a traditional manner. Other quantitative and qualitative data, including student's attitudes and experiences, was gathered through a post class survey. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This research paper seeks to evaluate the impact of collaborative learning on student persistence and the methods by which the impact is mediated. Collaboration is frequently listed among skills required for students to succeed in the workplace. Engineering standards include developing "an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams" as well as "an ability to communicate effectively." Active learning strategies, including collaborative learning techniques, have been encouraged to promote student learning and engagement. However, a gap exists in literature when it comes to connecting collaborative learning to student engagement and persistence. A model has been recommended whereby collaborative learning impacts turnover intention (persistence) while being mediated by factors of campus connectedness, a sense of community, and organizational commitment. Prior research has applied this model to participation in a computer supported collaborative learning environment and been able to significantly describe relationships between nearly all factors. The purpose of this study is to apply the model in an introductory design course and assess model fit for these factors influencing student persistence. Nine hundred fourteen students enrolled during two semesters of an introductory design thinking course were surveyed and included in analysis. The course is a flipped classroom where content materials are packaged via Blackboard and students use class time for interaction rather than lecture. Data was analyzed through structural equation modeling to simultaneously evaluate relationships among the factors. Results from the model are reported. Researchers found that usability of the online collaborative system positively impact collaborative learning. Next, collaborative learning leads to a greater sense of campus connectedness and sense of community for students. These two factors contribute to organizational commitment and reduction of turnover intention. Implications for this model include expansion of student attrition research as it relates to technology and engineering education and the contribution of this model to understanding student attitudes in the domain of engineering and design thinking. While collaborative learning is important the present research is an opportunity to assess its impact on students beyond the acquisition of new knowledge. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The instructional practice of flipped classrooms is being investigated where specific content is provided via online video lectures, and class time is devoted to hands-on practice of concepts. There are two courses involved in this study. The first - Electronic Instrumentation (the main electronics course taken by student outside of Electrical and Computer Engineering) - was transitioned to flipped instruction in 2010 using the Mobile Studio as student-owned personal instrumentation. The flipped environment evolved with basically the same instrumentation toolset through the Fall of 2013, after which Analog Discovery became the platform of choice and course development continued through the Spring of 2015. During this period in which a single instructor developed and delivered the course, student and faculty perceptions of the use of online video lectures and the in-class active experiential learning (i.e., how both methods were used, their impact on student affect and cognition, as well as facilitators and barriers) and documentation of the process of continual development used to refine the implementation of the flipped classroom approach, were documented in a series of papers and book chapters. Although many students have some prior experience with video lectures, their comfort levels have not been consistently. A major focus of this development effort has been to provide students with scaffolding infrastructure so they can become more confident and successful in this learning environment. In the last year of this period, students demonstrated an acceptance in learning via the flipped classroom approach. The majority of students indicated they would not change anything about the group learning process in the flipped classroom. Students noted limitations to learning; individual learning characteristics appeared to have an effect on student perceptions of learning in a flipped classroom. With the general success of the flipped approach and the availability of new, higher performance personal instrumentation, we transitioned all course activities to new hardware and software while also enhancing the personal interaction between students, teaching assistants and the instructor to address, as much as possible, how each student could best raise their level of expertise in electronics. A major evolutionary event in Electronic Instrumentation occurred in Fall 2015 when it was taken over by a new instructor. The second course is an entirely new first year Introduction to ECE Analysis, first offered also in the Fall of 2015. Lessons learned in Electronic Instrumentation and even significant content have had a strong impact on this new course. This paper will address the impact of these changes measured through student surveys, performance on class assignments and examinations and, in the case of Electronic Instrumentation, feedback from the new instructor. The new first year course, while superficially similar in topics covered to Electronic Instrumentation, is a very different course. First, because there are no formal college level prerequisites (only a typical high school science and math experience is assumed), circuit analysis emphasizes algebraic methods and preparation for future circuits and electronics courses. An even more important distinction is the emphasis on a more complete and integrated Experimental Centric Pedagogy (ECP) than has been the case in Electronic Instrumentation (EI). Essentially every concept is first introduced through an experiment (experiment first) which requires that a substantial fraction of time spent in and out of class is dedicated to enhancing the students skills as electronics experimenters. A new outcome for EI and also included in the new course is that students will be able to identify online circuit designs that are relevant to their design projects (in these and other courses) and be able to effectively modify the designs to meet the specific needs of their projects. This concept has been under limited development in EI. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {At East Carolina University (ECU), undergraduate students in an electrical engineering concentration within a general engineering program are required to complete a microprocessors course. This course has been taught for three years. During the first two years, the course was offered in a traditional format with three weekly lectures and one weekly hands-on lab. It was discovered that the weekly lab time was insufficient to complete several longer lab assignments and many students had to complete their lab assignments outside of the allotted lab period. It was also discovered that many students had misconceptions about course material and often attended office hours to get help understanding the material. During the third year, the instructor flipped the classroom by recording the lectures and posting them for students to watch before coming to class. While the contact time between the students and instructor remained the same throughout the week, the lecture periods were changed to include hands-on activities such as completing worksheets to assess lecture content knowledge, practice writing subroutines that could be used as part of the weekly lab assignment, or building circuits to interface external devices with a microcontroller. Each of the in-class activities was designed to measure student understanding of course topics and to offload some of the laboratory work done during previous semesters to the lecture period. This paper assesses the differences in student outcomes between the traditional and flipped format of the course. Common final exam question responses from the traditional and flipped offering are compared to showcase the differences in student comprehension of course topics. Student survey results are also assessed to determine the benefits and limitations of the flipped classroom approach versus the traditional classroom format. The shortcomings of the current format are addressed and suggestions for improvement based upon one semester of using a flipped classroom approach are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This research paper describes an investigation into the impacts of a flipped pedagogy on student-perceived classroom climate. We used the College and University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI) to assess the classroom climate in both the flipped class and various control classes that were not flipped. This inventory includes seven psychosocial dimensions of classroom climate: personalization, involvement, student cohesiveness, satisfaction, task orientation, innovation, and individualization. Our specific research questions were: 1. Do students perceive a more positive classroom climate in a flipped classroom vs. a traditional lecture-based course when controlled for course content and instructor? 2. What psychosocial dimensions were most impacted by the flipped pedagogy? 3. What do these results indicate about student motivation in a flipped classroom? One group of students (Group "A") had just completed the flipped course. The second group (Group "B") consisted of students who had just completed the same course, but taught in a traditional format. This was to control for the effect of the course material on student's motivation and interest. The third group (Group "C") consisted of students who had just completed a different engineering course taught by the same instructor in a traditional format. This was to control for a different instructor. The groups were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. The responses were analyzed based on each of the seven subscales within the CUCEI, as well as on an overall score combining all seven subscales. The results show that overall the flipped class results in a higher score in both overall classroom climate and for the individualization subscale. In addition we found higher averages for task orientation when controlled for instructor. When controlled for the course content, the flipped course is more innovative and students get to know each other more. The implications of these findings on flipped classrooms are important to those faculty wishing to flip their course. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We implemented a fully-flipped classroom approach in the introductory probability and statistics course for engineers during the Fall 2015 semester in our school of engineering. In the Fall 2014, we implemented a partially-flipped "pilot" flipped classroom approach when we inverted one third of the course material. Based on our "pilot" results in terms of both direct measures of student learning as well as measures of the classroom environment, we were highly encouraged and motivated to implement the fully-flipped classroom approach. In our flipped classroom, students watched recorded lectures prior to the class time, and time in the classroom was replaced with more active instructional activities. This approach allowed the instructor to include problem solving elements and focus on difficult concepts, encouraged questions and more interactions, and exposed students to more realistic scenarios, while still covering required material. This course is a required course for civil, computer, chemical, electrical, mechanical, material science and bio-engineering majors in our school. Each semester we teach two or three sections of this course. Our class materials, including lecture notes, class activities, homework assignments and quizzes, were revised in order to implement the flipped classroom approach. As part of our program evaluation, the flipped and partially-flipped classrooms were observed for the degree of active learning, problem solving, and student engagement during class using a structured behavioral observation protocol known as the Teaching Dimensions Observation Protocol (TDOP). We compared students' performance in the fully-flipped vs. partially-flipped classrooms; this allowed for direct assessment and comparison of a partially-flipped vs. fully-flipped approach for probability and statistics. The overall assessment compares the two approaches based on the conceptual knowledge gains on the Statistics Concept Inventory by Allen et al., targeted ABET outcomes, student engagement, instructor interviews, and two perception instruments measuring students' overall experiences in the class. These two instruments consist of Fraser's College and University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI) and a flipped-classroom evaluation survey, which we distributed to the students near the end of the semester. We also compared the results to those of other flipped classrooms in our school of engineering, which have been implemented as part of our school-wide initiative to flip engineering courses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have indicated that women account for about 18% of the engineering degrees awarded in the United States. Consistently low populations of women in engineering are often attributed to discrimination, the perception that engineering is a masculine domain, and a lack of understanding about the roles and responsibilities of an engineer. In order to increase participation of women in engineering, universities develop outreach programs designed to better educate students (and the public) about engineering. Programs in the form of information sessions, seminars or research activities are informative but often are not interactive or student-centered and may lack information about how different engineering disciplines interact in industry. To emphasize the multidisciplinary nature of engineering and to increase women's interest in pursuing engineering, a week-long residential summer program was created for female high school juniors and seniors implementing problem-based learning. Instructors from six engineering disciplines designed interactive and outcome-based topic lessons to introduce concepts and careers associated with their engineering fields. Lessons were structured to be student-centered using a flipped classroom model; students prepared for classes with short reading assignments, and class time was used for activities highlighting the engineering design process and physical concepts relevant to each discipline. To evaluate the efficacy of the lessons and the flipped classroom structure, a series of mixed assessment methods was implemented, which include: (i) instructor performance indicators - evaluated by students - measuring the quality of content, activities, delivery and relevance of the entire curriculum; and, (ii) students' self-assessment of key personal, interpersonal and intellectual traits before and after the program. Qualitative analysis of student responses to targeted prompts was also performed to observe shifts in students' perception of engineering during the program. Key results include high scores in instructor performance indicators, which suggest that adequate emphasis of relevant concepts by instructors during lessons, requisite student preparatory work before lessons, and interactive Q&A-style discussions contributed to a higher degree of perceived comprehension by students. Such high scores also support previous literature showing that students prefer an interactive, student-centered classroom structure. Qualitative results yield an evolved and matured perception of engineering among student participants and a more complete understanding of the individual engineering disciplines. Overall, evaluations led to the conclusion that the program structure was well received by students, and it sets the precedent for similar outreach programs in the future, enabling a continuous and long-term evaluation of the efficacy of an interactive curriculum. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The original structure of this class included a standard lecture format and assignments consisting of tutorials and exercises.

Secondly, the tutorials are written in a format which may be confusing and difficult to follow. In addition, these tutorials provide an emphasis on the tools to construct the CAD models, while dismissing the model planning stage, which is critical for an engineering design. The authors have attempted to address these drawbacks. Tutorial videos were created to clearly show the model construction process from start to finish. One instructor taught the course in the usual manner but made the tutorial videos available to the students. The second instructor converted the class to a "flipped" or inverted format and also used the tutorial videos. In both cases, access to the tutorial videos has significantly improved the experience of the students in the class. Regarding student performance, the students in the flipped classroom had much greater changes in performance relative to those in the standard classroom. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the first year results of an initiative to diffuse mobile, hands-on teaching and learning in all five engineering schools in Puerto Rico. The effort addresses engineering courses that have an electrical/electronic circuits component such as electrical networks, electronics, experimental methods, and mechanical vibrations. This effort relies on constructivist methodologies which are based on the widely accepted principle that students construct their own versions of reality rather than simply absorbing versions presented by their teachers. The Analog Discovery Board, essentially a circuits laboratory that fits in the palm of one's hand, is used as the medium to explore course concepts. Two NSF-funded faculty workshops in Puerto Rico serve as the primary means for diffusing the innovation. The first workshop was conducted at Universidad del Turabo in February 2015. The workshop introduced the board and parts kit to 16 participating faculty members from four of the five engineering schools in Puerto Rico. The workshop also provided pedagogical materials that have already been developed for some courses, including videos that can be used in a flipped classroom environment. The workshop was rated as "excellent" with an average score of 4.9 on a scale of 1 to 5. By the end of the first workshop, each faculty participant was ready to immediately start exploring mobile hands-on learning in their classrooms. Twenty Analog Discovery boards and parts kits were handed out to each participating institution to seed the diffusion effort. Results of a survey are presented in the paper. The results include diffusion rates as measured by the number of class sessions the board was used divided by the total number of class sessions held after the workshop. It also includes comments by the faculty that describe how the innovation was used in the classroom, comments on what held them back from implementing the board more often in their courses, what they liked best and least regarding the entire experience, a list of additional comments, and ideas for a future proposal. The participants are interested and motivated to continue working as a group to advance this innovation in Puerto Rico. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This, combined with very negative student reviews of the current textbook, convinced the author at Ohio Northern University (ONU) to experiment with a partially-flipped classroom in the fall semester of 2013. In preparation for this, the author found a tremendous amount of already-developed video and text resources available online for no cost, and often very high quality. This led to the idea for this paper - can a flipped classroom be taught using only these types of resources? This has been done twice now at ONU in a senior-level design course. The online content includes popular videos (such as TED talks), how-to guides (either video or text), and reference materials or case studies. Initial student responses have been very positive, with some students noting they are actually enjoying an engineering class for the first time. Surveys regarding this approach, as well as student performance on common final exam questions, are included. Preliminary findings indicate that in general this approach can work, but that there are certain content areas in which the available resources are very weak.

	abstract = {We implemented a hybrid flip classroom technique to enhance student learning experience. A flipped classroom technique is opposite to a traditional classroom teaching method in that lectures will be delivered online and homework is moved from home to classroom. We chose one of the foundation courses in engineering and engineering technology, ENGR 2110: Statics for modification so that this model could be expanded to other engineering courses. Our revitalized course differed from a traditional in-class and a complete online course in the following ways: (1) Lectures were summarized in 5-20 minute videos that include important concepts from the chapter/topic, one/two worked examples, and 3-4 homework/practice problems. These synopsis video lectures were made available to students in advance so that students could learn and prepare for the lectures/problem sessions. The lecture time was devoted to reciting the key concepts, working problems in class and identifying the important homework/practice problems with real world examples. The summary video helped instructors spend more time on working out the problems and examples in class. (2) The summary video could also help students who want to review the material covered in class at home and practice. Moreover, these videos were available for students who miss a class to go back and review what was covered in class and be up to speed for the next lecture. (3) The concept was different from a traditional all-online course which provided videos of full lectures online and did not provide opportunities for students to interact with the instructors and peers in class. In this method, the instructors spent more time on working problems and quizzes during normal classroom lecture times. (4) Instructors also utilized Desire to Learn (D2L) online course management tool in order to upload the videos and assigned practice problems for enhanced student learning experience. Our findings showed that this new technique of hybrid classroom/lectures helps new engineering educators to address the key challenges of modern classroom learning to keep students engaged, motivated, and interested in the subject. This hybrid model could benefit engineering educator community and can be expanded across and beyond engineering discipline. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A team of faculty at Rice University and other institutions has created instructional resources to support a flipped classroom model for first-year engineering design. Gone is the traditional 'class' in which faculty lecture on the design process and other professional skills. These 'lectures' are now delivered on video, essentially shifting low cognitive load work to videos that students watch outside of class. In class, students complete active learning exercises focused on the engineering design process. Afterwards, student teams also apply the engineering design process to their specific projects. The authors have created the following educational materials to flip the first-year multidisciplinary engineering design classroom: • Sixty web-based videos featuring student teams and faculty at Rice University as well as three other institutions that focus on steps of the engineering design process and professional skills. Topics include defining the problem, researching the design problem, framing design criteria, brainstorming solutions, selecting solutions with Pugh matrices, project planning using Gantt charts, prototyping, and testing. • Twenty-one online quizzes (with 10-25 questions each) that cover information discussed in the videos. Quizzes are multiple choice and true/false and test students' knowledge and application of the technical content in the videos. • Thirty in-class exercises that support active learning in the classroom. The in-class exercises typically require students to apply a specific step in the design process to a new problem, critique a completed design step, or synthesize knowledge. During the 2015-2016 academic year, all engineering design and professional skills lectures were flipped. The focus of this poster is to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate students' use of the videos, quizzes, and in-class exercises during the fall 2015 semester. Using analytics from YouTube and our course management software, we evaluated the percent of students who watched the videos, the number of students who started the videos, the average watch time, the percent of students who completed the quiz, and their grades. From this we learned that >80% of the students started the instructor videos, and that the number of student starts and average video watch time declined during a given playlist. Also, students performed well on quizzes, with an average score of 90%. These materials are available for others to use. The team is seeking feedback on developing materials that will be helpful for the academic community teaching engineering design. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It aims to improve student performance on activity-based team projects and address strategies for adding innovative flipped classroom approaches into hands-on courses. Video instruction has the potential to combine multiple learning styles in pre-class preparation material. This video teaching methodology for laboratory instructions and assignments provides needed information to students before they attempt the labs or use equipment to expedite the learning process. A first-year engineering program initiative to incorporate more flipped classroom resources began this last summer with the help of an on-campus support center for teaching and learning. This paper will focus on aspects of short, five to ten minute, video instruction that can be used to improve performance in hands-on design projects and labs. Many video projects performed by engineering educators focus on moving in-class lectures to hours of video. In a class that is primarily activity-based, different strategies should be used to add video instruction for equipment, software, and concepts. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The University of San Diego has a continuing program since the spring semester of 2012 for the investigation of pedagogical benefits of utilizing iPads and other mobile technology in instruction and student research. The "iPad Project" is two-phased: In the first phase iPad Faculty Pilot participants explore and discover new apps, and adapt curriculum in preparation for the second phase, the iPad Classroom Project. All students in an iPad Classroom Project designated course are issued university iPads during the semester at no cost. Several engineering courses have taken advantage of this program and incorporated iPads with flipped, hybrid-flipped, and traditional course instruction. The engineering courses that have participated or are participating in the iPad Project include electrical circuits, engineering materials science, and applied electromagnetics. Student participation in the Engineering iPad Project began in summer session 2014 with the first cohort in the sophomore level electrical circuits class. In the summer 2014 session of the electrical circuits course, fully flipped-teaching with technology augmentation using iPads was first employed. In the fall semester of 2014, iPad augmented flipped teaching was employed in a section of electrical circuits course and in a senior level applied electromagnetics course. In the spring semester and summer session of 2015, three sections of the electrical engineering courses participated in the iPad Classroom Project employing iPad augmented hybrid-flipped teaching. In the Fall semester of 2015, an Engineering Materials Science section participated in the iPad augmented course using traditional instruction. In a short three-week intersession time-compressed semester class in January 2016 for a senior level electrical engineering course, iPads supported a hybrid-flipped/blended classroom. iPads were used in conjunction with lecture notes, videos lectures, YouTube mashups, and supporting materials posted on the Blackboard learning management system. A course blog was also established where photographs of the answers to student questions in class, emphasis of main points in the video lessons, solution of sample problems, and worked student problem assignments were posted. Semester surveys have been conducted by the University Academic Instructional Services (iTeam) on the effectiveness of the iPad technology augmented classrooms. Results indicated that the use of iPads is positively received. Evolution to the hybrid-flipped classroom from fully flipped instruction, and a comparison to the Fall semester of 2015 traditional class instruction using iPads are summarized. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This research builds on recent studies which have assessed advantages and disadvantages of a flipped classroom as compared to a traditional face-to-face classroom in Electrical Engineering Circuit Analysis courses. Flipped classrooms afford more opportunity for problem solving activities with students reading and viewing pre-recorded lectures prior to each in-class session. A hybrid classroom incorporates components of both traditional face-to-face and online learning allowing for greater flexibility in enhancing the learning and improving the understanding of course material. We applied all three teaching pedagogies in a Circuit Analysis class in a recent semester at a first-tier public research university. Students were surveyed at the end of the semester to assess their perceptions of the course, confidence in performing tasks, and interest in a fully on-line course. Task competencies surveyed included: Knowing the basics of instruments used in electrical engineering; Measuring voltages and currents using instruments; Building a variety of AC/DC circuits; Analyzing and modeling circuit performance using simulation tools; Understanding the purpose or function of a presented circuit; Building a circuit based upon results of a design calculation. We elaborate further on the pros and cons of all three teaching methods, summarize students' perceptions and make suggestions based on the survey results and student comments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

These personal characteristics included gender, the availability of outside-school support and resources, foreign language beliefs, perceptions of their English teachers, and how they use the Internet. Through factor analysis, flipped learning readiness consists of five dimensions: learner control and self-directed learning, technology self-efficacy, motivation for learning, in-class communication self-efficacy, and doing previews. It was found that personal characteristics and individual circumstances, including language beliefs, student perceptions of teacher characteristics, the availability of outside-school support and resources, learning performance, study time and net-surfing time, can make a difference to the levels of the readiness dimensions. These findings may shed light on the middle schoolers' flipped learning readiness in EFL classrooms and provide insights for teachers wanting to incorporate individualized instruction in the flipped classroom. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {High failure rates in calculus have plagued students, teachers, and administrators for decades, while science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programmes continue to suffer from low enrollments and high attrition. In an effort to affect this reality, some educators are ‘flipping’ (or inverting) their classrooms. By flipping, we mean administering course content outside of the classroom and replacing the traditional in-class lectures with discussion, practice, group work, and other elements of active learning. This paper presents the major results from a three-year study of a flipped, first-semester calculus course at a small, comprehensive, American university with a well-known engineering programme. The data we have collected help quantify the positive and substantial effects of our flipped calculus course on failure rates, scores on the common final exam, student opinion of calculus, teacher impact on measurable outcomes, and success in second-semester calculus. While flipping may not be suitable for every teacher, every student, and in every situation, this report provides some evidence that it may be a viable option for those seeking an alternative to the traditional lecture model. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Delivery of manufacturing technology and practical workshop-based work, on undergraduate engineering courses that engage the learners, is challenging. The paper presents an experimental method of workshop delivery using the flipped learning approach, a pedagogical model in which the typical lecture and homework elements of a course are reversed. Video lectures are viewed by students prior to class. In-class time can be devoted to exercises, projects, or discussions as in this case. Learners were asked to observe three audiovisual clips in preparation for class. The objective was to determine whether the flipped classroom approach can enhance the learning experience, through better engagement with the students, compared to conventional classroom-based learning. The level of student participation and level of success have been established by means of feedback questionnaires from more than 100 participants and peer observation. The results are encouraging and demonstrate that this approach is favoured by the students. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In the first part of the course (first five weeks), students were invited to take a Courser a course named 'Emerging Trends &amp; Technologies in the Virtual K-12 Classroom.' In the latter part of the course (last five weeks), students were invited to learn Sakai-based course chapter contents and to do an OER-related assignment. 16 undergraduate students majored in education attended the course and wrote their learning diaries on the Sakai platform. 231 diaries were collected at the end of the class. Nvivo 8 was used for the qualitative analysis. The results indicated that students have not only experienced rich emotional changes during the MOOC-based flipped classroom practice, but also have they enriched in knowledge, perspectives, and skills and improved their metacognitive abilities.

Motivated by a desire to improve the interactivity in a computer science class, I designed and implemented an initiative to facilitate student interaction and teamwork: a flipped classroom.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, modern information technology is gradually changing people's life, study and work. People have clearly recognized that information collection, transmission, processing and application ability has become a most basic ability and the marker of the cultural level. Information technology, as a modern new discipline, compared with other subjects, it has its remarkable characteristics that in the process of learning it pays more attention to cultivate the students' ability of hands, brains and initiative exploration. As educators work in the line of the disciplines of information technology, seriously exploring the subject of teaching mode so as to do well the teaching of information technology course and improve the teaching effect is their responsibility. Nowadays, many students lack learning interest in information technology course. Investigating its causes, we find problems occur in the teachers' teaching methods. Most domestic schools generally use cramming teaching methods, blindly instill the knowledge in students no matter they have digested or attracted. For the knowledge teachers taught, they just heard and they just have the impression on the knowledge learned, ignoring the students' creative, hands-on, and thinking ability. This kind of traditional information technology course cannot well mobilize students' interest in learning information technology course. In contrast with the cramming method of teaching is the heuristic teaching method, whose important feature is considering the importance of the application of knowledge. Under the guidance of the teaching mode, flipped classroom concept in the heuristic teaching mode enters into people's vision. The flipped classroom refers to change the traditional teaching mode of teachers explaining the new knowledge for students in the classroom, and students consolidate new knowledge through their own independent homework to the teaching mode of students learning new knowledge independently after class and doing exercises to consolidate the digest new knowledge in the classroom with teachers. The author, after reading the flipped classroom theories and teaching research, combined with the characteristics of information technology disciplines, constructs information technology teaching model based on flipped classroom concept. In the practice process, test the effects of applying flipped classroom in information technology teaching, and gradually modifies and perfects it. Under the background of information culture in our country, explore the information technology teaching model based on flipped classroom concept characterized by the local culture. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Given the established nature of the class, Dynamic of Machinery could be considered for a flipped classroom model in which students watch a prerecorded lecture prior to class, and then spend class time practicing the theory through examples. One of the limitations to the flipped model is the concern that students have not fully grasped the material from the recorded lecture. This paper suggests the use of a concept quiz associated with each pre-recorded lecture as a required component to meet prior to attending the class. The concept quizzes are associated with each unit lecture and collectively should form a concept inventory for the class that defines the fundamental range of knowledge for successful students. This paper will present the format the concept quizzes and how they are used in the flipped class environment for a traditional, junior level kinematics of machinery course. The paper will present the concepts according to topics and divided among 39 lectures associated with each class. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the 2013-2014 school year, we implemented the "flipped classroom" as part of an initiative to drive active learning, student engagement and enhanced learning in our school. The flipped courses consisted of freshman through senior engineering classes in introductory programming, statics/mechanics, mechanical design, bio-thermodynamics, facilities layout/material handling, and chemical engineering dynamics and modeling. In the flipped classroom, students watch video lectures beforehand to obtain the foundational knowledge and then demonstrate skills during class. Our study set out to address the following research questions: 1) Does the flipped classroom promote student engagement during class, and does it positively impact the classroom environment?, 2) Is the flipped classroom associated with increased student achievement and learning of content?, and 3) What strengths, benefits, and drawbacks do students perceive with the flipped classroom? To address these, we used a mixed methods approach, including environment and evaluation surveys, instructor interviews, exam and homework results, video access data, and structured classroom observation. Based on our use of the College and University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI), we found evidence that flipped instruction can positively impact the classroom environment. We also used a behavioral observation protocol - the Teaching Dimensions Observation Protocol (TDOP) - to assess student engagement and involvement during class. We compared our results to a national TDOP study of 58 lecture-based STEM classrooms, formally demonstrating the advantages of our flipped classrooms. Behaviors such as student discussion and questions and problem solving were significantly higher in our flipped classrooms (p < 0.0001). Our pre-flip versus flip exam and homework results were mixed from a statistical improvement standpoint. However, based on instructor interviews we noted enhanced higher-order skills such as problem solving and deeper engagement and proficiency in some courses and with some students. Unfortunately, we encountered challenges with our freshman and seniors. The great majority of freshmen did not use the videos for first-time instruction. The seniors expressed resistance to and dissatisfaction with this instructional change. Both freshmen and seniors rated their classroom environments statistically lower than the sophomores and juniors did. We uncovered other instances in the literature of these challenges. Nonetheless, we believe that flipped instruction is a valuable approach for promoting engagement and learning. We discuss lessons learned, including the need to educate students about the expectations of the flipped classroom. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the problem-solving studio (PSS) learning environment. PSS was designed to teach students how to solve difficult analytical engineering problems without resorting to rote memorization of algorithms, while at the same time developing their deep conceptual understanding of the course topics. There are several key features of PSS. First, students work in teams of two to solve problems, working at the same table with another team of two. The student teams and tables are stable, remaining together for most of the semester. The teams work in a public, shared problem-solving space that allows in-class mentors (near peers of the students) and the instructor to observe and critique their work. The public nature of the work enables the instructor to provide students with real-time, situated feedback. In addition, it enables the instructor to tailor the challenge level to the needs of each team, such that the problem is too difficult for any one student to solve on their own, but reasonable enough that the team can solve it together, given the support that the PSS environment provides. We call this targeted adjustment of the problem's difficulty dynamic scaffolding. PSS provides the support students need through a specific set of participant structures that govern how the instructors, in-class mentors, and students interact during class. This paper describes the PSS approach and how it has been implemented in an entry-level course at Georgia Tech called "Conservation Principles of Biomedical Engineering (BMED 2210)". Our results show that even though PSS emphasizes engineering problem-solving skills, the students' conceptual understanding of the material significantly improves, as measured by Shallcross' material and energy balances concept inventory. The implications of our work, particularly with respect to the use of PSS in flipped classrooms, are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Blended, flipped, and semi-flipped instructional approaches were used in various sections of a numerical methods course for undergraduate mechanical engineers. During the spring of 2014, a blended approach was used; in the summer of 2014, a combination of blended and flipped instruction was used to deliver a semi-flipped course; and in the fall of 2014, a fully-flipped approach was taken. Blended instruction aims to integrate technology-driven instruction with face-to-face learning and is often used to enhance the traditional lecture. With "flipped" instruction, students practice skills during class after viewing or/and reading lecture content beforehand. To directly assess these instructional methods, we compared multiple-choice and free response results from identical final exams. We did this for all students as well as demographic segments of interest to our research, including underrepresented minorities and transfer students. We uncovered several differences having medium to large effect sizes, suggesting that some degree of flipped instruction may have been more beneficial than blended learning for both lower and higher-order skills development. The students rated the classroom environment using Fraser's College and University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI). The three classroom environments were statistically similar with small effect sizes. However, there was a trend in lower ratings for the flipped and semi-flipped classrooms versus the blended classroom across the various environmental dimensions. This may indicate that blended instruction had the most desirable classroom environment. Based on an evaluation survey, only 38% of respondents preferred flipped instruction to usual methods, although 54% preferred active learning to lecture. In an open-ended question, the most frequently-stated benefits of flipped instruction involved enhanced learning or learning processes, and engagement and professional behaviors. These results aligned with our focus group results. This study is believed to be one of the first to compare these three modalities in a STEM course. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Faculty at Rice University are creating instructional resources to support teaching first-year engineering design using a flipped classroom model. This implementation of flipped pedagogy is unusual because content-driven, lecture courses are usually targeted for flipping, not project-based design courses that already incorporate an abundance of active learning. However, during the first five semesters in which first-year engineering design was offered at Rice, almost 30% of class time conformed to the traditional lecture model. In fall 2014 a partially flipped model that placed greater emphasis on higher levels of Bloom's taxonomy during class time was introduced to facilitate student development in design topics. To achieve this goal, lecture time was replaced with in-class exercises that require students to analyze and evaluate design situations or problems, many of which were carefully crafted to expose common pitfalls that occur during the design process. To date, the team has produced flipped classroom resources for ten modules of the engineering design process and professional skills: design criteria, user-defined scales, pairwise comparison charts, brainstorming, decomposition, morphological charts, Pugh screening matrix, Pugh scoring matrix, Gantt charts, and presenting a design proposal. Each module includes three components: topical videos, summative quizzes, and in-class exercises. Work is ongoing to examine the impact of using a flipped classroom model in this first-year engineering design course. Two assessment methods have been deployed, and a third one is underway. One assessment method uses a pre- and post-course assignment to measure students' application of the design process. A second method focuses on student exam scores. A direct comparison of student learning in the partially flipped model versus the lecture model shows no statistically significant differences, which is consistent with some implementations reported in the literature. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Education and pedagogy are being transformed by developments in information technology and advances in learning theory that provide opportunities for improved outcomes in agricultural engineering education. The flipped classroom is a pedagogical model in which learning activities not requiring human interaction take place outside the classroom (enabled by technology) and learning activities requiring human interaction take place in the classroom (virtual or physical). A pilot study compared the performance and preference by graduate students in a food chain logistics agricultural engineering course learning using a flipped classroom and a traditional face-to-face lecture modes of instruction. Two contiguous modules were developed in both modes of instruction. Students were divided into two groups, each group learning the course material using one module in each mode of instruction. Students learning by the flipped classroom mode of instruction achieved significantly higher and more uniform test scores. Mean percentage scores for the flipped classroom ranged from 97.6% to 100% while mean scores under the conventional lecture ranged from 62% to 78.5%, with standard deviations ranging from 0 to 2.1 and 18.7 to 23.6, respectively. Also, a high level of significance (p<0.0001) was found showing a preference for the flipped classroom mode of instruction for the subject group. Students perceived they learn more, in less time, under the flipped classroom model. The results of this study suggest that agricultural engineering education outcomes could be improved by appropriate use of the flipped classroom model of teaching and learning. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The objective of this approach is to develop an instructional framework that promotes self-directed learning and enhances problem-solving skills in undergraduate engineering students without sacrificing knowledge of fundamental engineering principles. In this framework, material traditionally covered in a lecture format is moved outside of class time, developed for an on-line format, and made available in an online learning management system. In-class time is used to solve engineering problems in teams and under guidance of an instructor. The problems are co-developed with practicing engineers from aerospace, medical device, HVAC and process industries. The framework was implemented in a Heat Transfer course. Students taught using the new framework showed improvement in self-directed learning and problem-solving skills over students taught in a traditional setting without losing basic skills. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom is becoming increasingly popular at universities because of its perceived benefits in promoting active learning and decreasing educational costs. Studies have found positive benefits associated with flipped classrooms; however, many have failed to control for confounding factors. Examples of confounding factors include comparing courses taught by different instructors or across courses taught in different semesters using different quizzes. The objective of this paper is to compare the traditional and flipped classrooms in an undergraduate civil engineering course while controlling for potential confounding factors. The quasi-experimental study incorporates students' online behaviors, in-class performance, office hour attendance, and responses to both attitudinal and behavioral questions to assess student opinions and learning outcomes. It was found that student performance on quizzes was not significantly different across the traditional and flipped classrooms. A key shortcoming noted with the flipped classroom was students' inability to ask questions during lectures. Students in flipped classrooms were more likely to attend office hours compared to traditional classroom students, but the difference was not statistically significant. Future research should explore whether students' inability to ask questions when the material is presented in flipped classrooms affects learning outcomes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Many University lecturers in Germany face the challenge of teaching very large classes, sometimes including 1000 or even more students. They often have to cope with a very high level of noise, bad room conditions, an extremely low level of participation as well as interaction and feedback. Some lecturers therefore try to overcome these challenges by using technology in their classroom. Previous research has already focused on evaluating the use of audience response systems (ARS) in a traditional but very large engineering lecture. This sort of technology has proven to be an effective tool in order to e. g. increase student motivation, give them additional support in the learning process and on the other hand give the lecturer feedback about the students’ learning progress as well as possible crucial points of the lecture. This paper, however, goes one step further. It analyzes the use of ARS in a flipped classroom setting of a large engineering lecture for first-year-students. After having completed almost two thirds of the flipped classroom lecture, students were being questioned about their experiences and opinions about the use of ARS in this particular educational setting. The standardized questionnaire included questions issuing e. g. comprehension, motivation, frequency, enjoyment, interaction, involvement as well as usability aspects. First results show that e. g. the majority of the students feel that clicker questions foster their comprehension, motivate them to be attentive and increase the quality of the lecture. When comparing the results to findings from previous research in a traditional lecture, however, one thing becomes apparent: The evaluation of the use of ARS in the in a flipped classroom setting has turned out to be slightly less positive than that of the traditional lecture. This finding will be particularly discussed and may even call for further research in the designated field of interest. In a first step, the lecture itself will be described considering content, background and general settings. Subsequently, the survey instrument and methodology will be presented. In a third step, the results of the survey will be presented and discussed. Finally, further research fields will be identified. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The digitalization of higher education in general and Blended Learning in particular have been focused for a long time. Next to applying newtechnology, focusing on interdisciplinary competences during studies has always been part of engineering studies. The lecture Communication and Organization Development (KOE) is a constituent part of the Bachelor’s studies of the faculty of mechanical engineering, addressing 1500 freshmen of the RWTH Aachen University. Since decades the lecture KOE is part of frequently used revision along with an agile progression of applied mixed methods and new demands using the previously mentioned teaching development. The number of first semester students is still increasing and freshmen entering the university are partially minors (17 years old) due to the shortened school career. To master these and further challenges successfully, the didactical method mix is based on a cube model developed by Baumgartner and Payr (1996), which combines different levels and perspectives of a student-centred teaching approach. Elements such as the flipped classroom concept (Bretzmann, J. (2013): Flipping 2.0. Practical strategies for flipping your class, Bretzmann Group, LLC) (Bergmann. J., Sams, A. (2012): Flip your classroom. Reach every student in every class every day. International Society for Technology in Education, ASCD) along with the discussion forum, which were introduced during winter term 2013/2014, have become a permanent feature of KOE. Moreover, blended learning elements were increased by attaching a two-stage business simulation called ROBOFLEX to bring the theoretical elements to an immersive, problem-based learning approach. This paper presents the cube model’s current status as part of the method mix of KOE. Additionally, based on last year’s evaluation results, the paper examines student’s reactions towards the tutorial class ROBOFLEX as well as its potential for optimization. Furthermore a general analysis of the evaluation results from winter term 2013/2014 compared with 2014/2015 is performed to identify scope for the further development of KOE. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This results in only very few of the 100,000,000 lecture hours given annually by colleges around the world being recorded - an enormous waste of valuable content LectureMonkey is a student and teacher collaborative solution, which leverages students mobiles to record any lecture anywhere, turn any classroom into a collaborative, active classroom and any lecture into a blended learning experience. LectureMonkey has been doing research in the marketplace over the last two years - letting students and teachers use the system to record and share lectures. We have used iterative and agile methodologies to quickly modify the product based on feedback. During these iterations we have learned what works and what doesn't, and what it will take to spark mass lecture capturing. LectureMonkey has been downloaded about 60,000 times, and has been used to record around 2,800 lectures (about 180 a month). Lectures have been viewed 14,000 times by 3,400 users. Just imagine how learning would change if everyone knew that at the end of class they would have a recording available - not just audio, but rich media that includes audio, boards and presentation. Add student comments as a natural part of the flow of the recording, mix in sharing among classmates and you have a recipe to radically improve the way students learn. LectureMonkey provides the ability to automatically capture every lecture using smartphones, making those recordings a part of the class notes - which can be easily shared with and enhanced by classmates. Needing only a smartphone and access to the Internet, LectureMonkey combines lecture capture (high quality audio, board images and presentation capture) and collaborative comments into a crowd sourced, shared, multimedia summary of a class. Students can have all their lectures and notes in their pocket or in a browser - available anytime, anywhere. • LectureMonkey is the only solution for mass ad-hoc lecture capture for live lectures anywhere, anytime - even though lecture capturing has a proven benefit for students. • LectureMonkey modernizes class notes. Class notes are crucial to learning, but haven't really changed since the 1950's. LectureMonkey combines lecture recording together with the mobile paradigms of texting, tweeting, snapchat for collaborative note taking to enhance learning. • LectureMonkey democratizes modern pedagogical strategies like flipped classrooms and peer learning by making it simple for every live lecture to easily become an active, e-Learning experience that embraces paradigms natural to today's students. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This course has for years had the same traditional set-up that is common also in other engineering schools around the world including lectures, mandatory programming assignments, and a final written exam. What we did was to substitute the lectures for in-class sessions based on a variant of the teaching method known as 'flipping the classroom' combined with certain elements of Peer Discussion and Just-in-time teaching. To make all this work, we introduced a web-based MOOC tool into the course. To be able to investigate the quantitative effects of our experiment, we had an experiment class consisting of 70 students taking the course in this new way and a control class of 57 students taking the course in the traditional way. On the final written exam, which was identical for the two classes and marked the same way, 81% of the students in the experiment class passed compared to 60% in the control class. Moreover, the share of students passing with good grades was 58% in the experiment class compared to 32% in the control class. So, not only did the share of students passing the course increase by a third, but also the share of students passing with good grades almost doubled. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This Work In Progress focuses on student perceptions of the effectiveness of three content delivery modes; a) traditional, residential in-class b) class capture for asynchronous online delivery, and c) modularized targeted content videos for online and blended or flipped classroom mode. Despite the growth of MOOCs and the concomitant shift from long lecture videos to learning modules, many online courses still rely on a class capture method. A recent study on video use by students in online courses recommends the use of short videos, six to nine minutes in length, based on student viewing habits. [1] The student behavior was inferred from click-stream data captured within the LMS but there was no direct interaction with students to gauge impressions of the content delivery or impact on learning. To improve both the residential and online experience requires a deeper understanding of those features which promote learning in each approach. Some of this understanding can be gleaned from traditional academic course evaluations, but student perceptions yield an additional level of understanding. For this study we analyzed data from multiple offerings of a 7-week graduate level numerical analysis course; Application of Finite Element Analysis. Over three years this course was offered residentially and online using multiple delivery modes. We categorize the delivery modes as Traditional, Class-Capture, and Modularized/Blended. Each student studied the material using one delivery mode and was then asked to review the material using another delivery mode. The students were asked to evaluate the perceived learning attained based on their original content delivery mode and the alternate mode. The feedback from this analysis, combined with traditional course evaluations will be used to develop a more comprehensive and objective survey to be used in the next round of courses. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {From overhead transparencies to interactive documents, teaching and learning engineering has changed dramatically over the years. A flipped or hybrid course is a pedagogical model that reverses typical lecture and homework elements of a course. Class time is used for discussions and group activities with lecture materials being introduced in an on-line format. As research has shown, this model allows students to typically demonstrate higher levels of learning. This paper will detail the associated learning by students through the author's transition from a typical lecture-based sophomore-level engineering class to a hybrid model. The author will address how learning can be increased through the use of active engagement tools, such as iClickers. To address this question and gauge the overall impact on student learning, a post-course survey was used to measure the perceived value for students. In addition, evidence for improved student engagement was gathered qualitatively to compare with previous experiences. Results show that active engagement tools helped students become active learners, increased interaction with peers and instructor, and helped them evaluate whether material was understood to motivate further learning. Moreover, students benefitted from the instructor being able to pinpoint misconceptions earlier due to instant feedback from students in the class. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

As part of the flipped class intervention trialed over a three-week period, a series of short themed video lectures were developed as a replacement for the traditional weekly lectures. The weekly practical lab session were redesigned to incorporate small-group problem solving tasks and assessment. Data from student surveys, interviews, class observations, and video analytics were collected and analyzed. Findings revealed that students were familiar with online videos as a learning resource; they had positive past experiences with using them and were willing to participate in a flipped classroom. However, most students did not watch all assigned weekly videos, including ones crucial to their TC learning. There is indication they thought learning strategies involving interactions with real persons to be more useful to their learning. This suggests that current strategies for motivating students to access and engage with the prepared videos need to be revised to maximize students' learning opportunities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The major drawback of this approach has been the difficulty of getting the students engaged in a traditional lecture. A computer science course in programming seems to be a natural class to implement a flipped classroom approach: individualized pacing for theory with cohort based skill acquisition. A flipped classroom is a form of blended instruction where students learn course content outside of the classroom and either homework or other forms of active learning activities occurs in the classroom. Herein is a summary of our observations based on several semesters of implementing a flipped classroom and report on observations made. There are numerous advantages to flipping a class such as allowing for more interaction during the face-to-face class meetings; it also allows for deeper learning to take place as students get their hands-on practice. We explore these practices and more, and compare and contrast what worked and what didn't work from our experiences. We also identify procedures critical to success and what procedures we view as less important. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The design and implementation of a learning environment that leverages on the use of various technologies is presented. The context is an undergraduate core engineering course within the biomedical engineering curriculum. The topic of the course is data analysis in biomedical engineering problems. One of the key ideas of this study is to confine the most mathematical and statistical aspects of data analysis in prerecorded video lectures. Students are asked to watch the video lectures before coming to class. Since the classroom session does not need to cover the mathematical theory, the time is spent on a selected real world scenario in the field of biomedical engineering that exposes students to an actual application of the theory. The weekly cycle is concluded with a hands-on tutorial session in the computer rooms. A potential problem would arise in such learning environment if the students do not follow the recommendation of watching the video lecture before coming to class. In an attempt to limit these occurrences, two key instruments were put in place: a set of online self-assessment questions that students are asked to take before the classroom session and a simple rewards system during the classroom session. Thanks to modern learning analytics tools, we were able to show that, on average, 57.9% of students followed the recommendation of watching the video lecture before class. The efficacy of the learning environment was assessed through various means. A survey was conducted among the students and the gathered data support the view that the learning environment was well received by the students. Attempts were made to quantify the impacts on learning of the proposed measures by taking into account the results of selected questions of the final examination of the course. Although the presence of confounding factors demands caution in the interpretation, these data seem to indicate a possible positive effect of the use of video lectures in this technologically enhanced learning environment. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The rapid increase use of information technologies throughout educational institutions is changing the way teachers and students learn, work, and establish collaboration. The learning cycle is an ongoing process that is designed to improve the quality of, as well as collaboration among learners. Recent announcements from top Universities to turn to new forms of educational delivery called "MOOCs" (Massive Open Online Courses), have not only captured the interest of academics and students in higher education, but also the interest of students and teachers in the K-12 environment, in home schooling, or outside the classroom in general. With MOOCs, the teaching method is moving from the traditional transfer learning model where the teacher serves as the repository and transmitter of knowledge to the flipped classroom model where the learner interacts with other students, peers, and has flexible access to all information and resources around him before coming to the classroom. With the huge amount of online educational material this has become a useful and beneficial method in teaching. Speaking at the Association of Community College Trustees' leadership meeting in Seattle, October 2013 (gatesfoundation.org), Bill Gates said "The value of MOOCs comes when you use them to create hybrids that are the best of both worlds. Rather than having the instructor lectures during class and then send the students home with assignments, many instructors are now using MOOCs to flip the classroom". He also added "I'd be the first to say this is a period of experimentation, but we'll learn much faster if people jump in and engage". Hester Tinti-KaneVice President of Marketing and Social Media Strategy, Pearson (Seaman & Tinti-Kane (2013)), said "The more we know about effective uses of technologies for teaching and learning, the faster we can adopt these new practices, facilitate their proliferation across higher education, and increase student success". These massive open online courses which have global reach, unlimited participation, and open access over the internet via a combination of social networking and video podcasts is attracting a huge variety of students of different ages, nationalities, backgrounds, abilities, interests, etc. It's all based on connection where you have the ability to learn, interact, and collaborate not only locally and globally but also universally from anywhere and at any time. With MOOCs providers in the USA (Coursera, edX, Udacity), Europe (FUN, Iversity), UK (FutureLearn), Middle East (Rwaq, Edraak), or in Australia (Open2study) students can work on learning content outside of the classroom, at their own pace, and practice the application of what they learned in class. While some educators consider MOOCs as the future of higher education, others said they represent the beginning of education downfall. According to many surveys, it has been found that faculty members are not rejecting technology, in fact most of them believe in the ability of technology to bring transformative change to education but at the same time they feel that commercial considerations, rather than pedagogical considerations are driving the phenomenon of MOOCs. The objective of this study is to provide insights into recent developments of MOOCs and how they can be incorporated into high school curriculum. While it's too soon to say if MOOCs represent a substitution to traditional courses, they certainly bring a transformative change to our actual education in general and to the way our academic institutions are working. For high school for example MOOCs could be used as blended-learning approach particularly in math and science. In higher education there is a lot of excitement about MOOCs and universities are still working hard on how to use them and what impact they could have on the value of a degree. A survey has been conducted to understand how students perceive learning outside the classroom through social media, online courses, school website, and private tutoring. 310 students have been surveyed during their end of the year exams at Global International School, an international school licensed by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Education and open to all expatriates in the Jeddah community, and accredited by the International Accreditation body "Advanced" (http://www.advanc-ed.org/). On the question "Learning outside the Classroom has a Positive Impact on my Education" 44.52% said they strongly agree with the statement and 51.61% said they agree while 2.58% neither agree nor disagree. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Blended learning has been received great interest in higher education around the world since it can increase access and flexibility for learners, increase level of active learning and achieve better student experiences and outcomes. Blended learning becomes popular to Higher Education Institutions community in Malaysia since a number of public and private universities were committed to bring the blended learning approach in their teaching and learning activities. Medium-impact blended learning has been used in BEng in Civil Engineering Programme, Bachelor Degree in International Business Programme and UK Degree Transfer Law Programme at INTI International University, Malaysia. Teaching techniques used in our classrooms were raptivity, flipped classroom and assessment and rubric on blackboard. The objectives of this study are to provide information on a variety of learning and teaching strategies that used in engineering and law subjects to support blended learning and to find out the perception of students on blended learning practices introduced in their classrooms. As for an academic, more initial preparation time is required to design a suitable blended learning model. Based on the response from the students, about half of the respondents neither agreed nor disagreed with the statements for contentment with blended courses. About 25% of the respondents would like to have more blended courses. It may be concluded that most students were not comfortable with online activities and they still preferred the traditional classes although blended learning has the proven potential to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of meaningful learning experiences. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Since the launch of this curriculum reform in 2008, more than 100 members of the faculty and staff have collaborated to design and deliver novel instructional activities for first and second year medical students. To date, five iterative processes of analysis, development, evaluation, and revision have been completed with large classes of medical students, with each class enrolling over 150 students. The 18-month Pre-Clerkship curriculum is supported by newly created system and technological infrastructure, and is continuously evaluated to assess the impact on students' learning. Lessons learned from each iteration inform revisions to curricular practices and infrastructure for subsequent iterations of the curriculum. As implementation of this innovative curriculum has progressed over several years, emergent issues have also stimulated medical education research projects that explore the implementation of Flipped Classroom Model and Team-Based Learning. In summary, the curriculum reform described in this paper provides valuable lessons for educators interested in implementing large-scale curricular innovations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Improving student engagement in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses generally, and organic chemistry specifically, has long been a goal for educators. Recently educators at all academic levels have been exploring the "inverted classroom" or "flipped classroom" pedagogical model for improving student engagement in subjects spanning the fields from liberal arts to business studies to science and technology. This learner-centered pedagogy, in which course content is delivered outside the classroom, allows class time to be more productively used for higher-level engaging activities, such as collaborative and problem-based learning through instructor-led applications of the material delivered outside of class. The techniques used and the technology employed to deliver an inverted two-semester organic chemistry classroom at Rowan College at Gloucester County along with preliminary student performance data versus the traditional lecture classroom format are presented. This communication summarizes one of the invited papers to the ConfChem online conference Flipped Classroom, held from May 9 to June 12, 2014, and hosted by the ACS DivCHED Committee on Computers in Chemical Education (CCCE). © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A flipped classroom was used in three separate engineering design classes during the 2014-15 academic school calendar. Two of these classes were offered in a computer lab to less than 30 students (one class was divided into sections for ease of instructional delivery) and one was offered to a large class in a lecture format without the availability of computers for each student. The flipped components relied on online video tutorials that were posted on YouTube and then embedded in the library guides for the discipline. This paper provides the results from an analysis of page views alongside usage statistics from YouTube. Both of these sources of information along with post-test results provided useful data in determining the effectiveness of flipped teaching in both a large lecture format and a smaller computer lab setting. The highest engagement scores were seen from the classes taught in a computer lab. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

With the primary objective of increasing student interest and learning, an integrated instructional design framework is proposed to provide first-year engineering and technology students with practical knowledge of DC. The research presented here compares the effectiveness of the flipped course to the previous traditional course through a controlled experimental study. The improved effectiveness of the flipped course is confirmed through the significant increase in course content and significant improvements in students' performance and their perceptions of their learning experience. Preliminary results suggest that students' academic success, and their engagement and interest in engineering, can be enhanced by refinement of an integrated instructional design framework. The authors believe that this positive outcome is a result of alignment of online preview of lectures, face-to-face student/instructor and peer interactions, discussions, hands-on activities, combined with several active learning strategies infused into the class. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the partial inversion of ME 450, an introductory dynamic system modeling course at Penn State University. To invert or 'flip' a course is to (i) introduce students to core concepts outside of class time, thereby (ii) creating more room for in-class active learning. Typically students watch lecture videos as homework, then solve related exercises in teams, with instructor assistance, in the classroom. In the Fall semester of 2013, the authors flipped ME 450, but only partially: the first 30% of the course was flipped, while the remainder was taught through a traditional lecture format. This allowed the authors to observe some distinctions between the two formats. The goal of this paper is to describe the above classroom flip to the system dynamics and control community, and share some of the associated firsthand observations. The subjective nature of these observations is indisputable, and the paper should therefore be viewed as a record of experiences rather than rigorous summary of objective findings. Penn State University's Leonhard Center for Enhancement of Engineering Education has conducted an internal review board (IRB)-approved, objective assessment of the ME 450 course flip, the results of which complement this paper but are intended for independent dissemination. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Students are given time to reflect and write the "muddiest" (least clear) point on an index card, to hand in as they leave class. This practice of assigning end-of-lecture reflection tasks to generate explicit student feedback is well suited for adaptation to the challenge of supporting feedback in online video lectures. We describe the design and evaluation of Mudslide, a prototype system that translates the practice of muddy cards into the realm of online lecture videos. Based on an in-lab study of students and teachers, we find that spatially contextualizing students' muddy point feedback with respect to particular lecture slides is advantageous to both students and teachers. We also reflect on further opportunities for enhancing this feedback method based on teachers' and students' experiences with our prototype. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The SS-capture system records Screenshots as a series of still images synchronously with input from a microphone. The resultant recording is akin to a slide show and can be readily distributed and viewed on-line using a web server and browser respectively. The SS-capture system removes barriers that ordinarily inhibit average teachers in faculties of engineering, who often lack a background in educational technology, from implementing a flipped classroom. Although the SS-capture system requires students to exert more effort than in a traditional lecture-based classroom, they nevertheless gave it high praise since it allowed them to learn at their own pace. The benefits of flipped classrooms include increased learning time, proactive student participation/interaction, a subjective understanding of course content, and a substantial rise in academic performance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recent technical and infrastructural developments posit flipped classroom approaches ripe for exploration. Flipped classroom approaches have students use technology to access the lecture and other instructional resources outside the classroom in order to engage them in active learning during in-class time. Scholars and educators have reported a variety of positive outcomes of a flipped (or inverted) approach to instruction. Although, flipped classroom practices have been used in a number of education studies, the detailed framework and data obtained from students' interaction with the technology materials are typically not described. In this paper, we present a flipped classroom framework and the first captured results of such data. The framework incorporates basic e-learning tools and traditional learning practices, making it accessible to anyone wanting to implement a flipped classroom experience in his/her course. The framework is structured on open-source and easy-to-use tools, allowing for the incorporation of any additional specificities of a course. This work-in-progress can provide insights for other scholars and practitioners to further validate, examine, and extend the proposed approach. This approach can be used for those interested in incorporating flipped classroom in their teaching, since it is a flexible procedure that may be adapted to meet their needs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {If the last decade was of the rise of online content, the coming one is likely going to focus on how best to use this content in the teaching and learning of the chemistry curriculum. The boundary between online material and the content as delivered in the lecture hall is becoming increasingly blurred, as educators seek to use the online space to support and supplement their in-class teaching. Online materials can be used to prepare for lectures or laboratories and supplement lecture content with additional explanatory material. Classroom conversation can move online to discussion boards, and there is a diversity in assessment methods available, often automated, which allows students to get immediate feedback on their understanding of a topic. The lecturer's toolkit has expanded enormously, and the difficulty is likely to center on how best to design the curriculum delivery to meaningfully incorporate learning technologies so that they enhance learning in and out of the classroom. In this chapter, we present a series of learning technologies, some better known than others, with an emphasis on how they may be usefully incorporated into the twenty-first century classroom. We advocate these technologies by basing them on what is known about how people learn. In order to be useful to practitioners in higher education, we supplement them with examples from the chemistry practice literature. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Therefore, the current study aimed to examine the impact of an online learning community in a flipped classroom, specifically via mobile platforms, on EFL learners' oral proficiency and their perceptions. Forty eight English-majored sophomores enrolled in two oral training classes at a four-year comprehensive university in central Taiwan were recruited to participate in this study. A mixed method was employed to analyze multiple sources of data, including pre- and post-tests on oral reading and comprehension questions, a "Community of Inquiry" (CoI) questionnaire, and the teachers' in-class observations. The flipped instruction measured by the CoI indicated that the online learning community not only facilitated meaningful and positive collaboration, but also significantly improved the participants' oral proficiency, making them feel more competent in those highly interactive learning events, such as storytelling, dialogue interaction, class discussion, and group presentations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The current program for Mechanical Engineering at the RWTH Aachen University in Germany has more than 1500 students enrolled. Lego Mindstorms' NXT Robots are fully integrated in the current Engineering Education stream to help students practically apply theoretical concepts. The courses Communication and Organizational Development (KOE) and Computer Science in Mechanical Engineering 1 (INFO1), provided by the interdisciplinary institute cluster IMA/ZLW, follow a newly-designed "blended learning" approach. This institute cluster is composed of the Institute of Information Management in Mechanical Engineering (IMA) and the Center for Learning and Knowledge Management (ZLW). These institutes are currently within the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at RWTH Aachen University. Two years ago, the course KOE was redesigned and redirected towards a "Flipped Classroom" concept by initiating online lectures and a discussion class. Thus, the tutorial class ROBOFLEX as part of the KOE curriculum is introduced. ROBOFLEX is a two-stage business simulation that enables students to experience realistic virtual communication within computer science and engineering disciplines. Students are divided into groups of about thirty people, and become entrepreneurs and founders of start-ups that specialize in the production of innovative robots for the automotive industry. They create these robots using Lego Mindstorms' NXT. Since its conception, the course INFO1 has been accompanied by a lab component, where students apply the concepts taught in class in a team-focused software design project. In 2011, the lab concept was changed into a two-stage robotics programming project based on Lego Mindstorms' NXT Robots and the Java programming language. In the first stage, students practice the fundamental programming concepts that are presented in the lecture by completing a series of exercises in a self-paced manner. The second stage focuses on applied problem-solving. In this stage, pairs of students apply the previously-learned programming concepts to program a "pickand- place" robot that is equipped with various sensors. The integration of Lego Mindstorms' NXT Robots into these courses also join the concepts of the two described courses. While KOE delivers organizational and communicational skills, INFO1 provides technical and domain-specific skills. Here, the robots represent the connecting element. The problem-based second stage of INFO1 benefits from the skills that are taught in KOE. Because INFO1 is scheduled in the term following the KOE, it offers a direct opportunity for students to transfer the KOE skill set from the lecture where it was taught into a new context that is primarily concerned with a different subject. Both classes have been evaluated and developed independently in the past. Since last year's introduction of ROBOFLEX in KOE, synergies between both lectures are becoming a main component of their further developments. In this paper the recent developments in both courses will be compared and discussed. Specific measurable effects concerning learning capability, motivation and learning endurance are being portrayed by using blended learning approaches. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom is currently the popular trend in education where content delivery is assigned as homework or pre-classwork and assignments are completed as classroom activities in-class as well as after-class activities. Clicker technology when used for assessment for learning has the powerful potential to flipped the classroom in a pedagogical approach. To investigate whether assessment for learning using clicker technology could flipped mathematic course. Participants were enrolled for flipped undergraduate mathematics II course at a study university of technology in South Africa. In order to establish the changes in students' academic performance, Technology Engagement Teaching Strategy (TETS) was used in the classroom and weekly clicker continuous assessments were conducted. A semester test results were used to established the significant difference between clicker test and semester test. Finally, a survey questionnaire was administered. Students' perspectives and their experiences of using clickers in a flipped mathematics course were also surveyed. The results showed that assessment for learning to flipped classroom using clickers tends to enhance students' mathematical communication skills, and help to develop the skills needed to write as well as read mathematical proofs. This suggests that clicker assessment activities have the ability to assist students to grasp the content and enabled them to apply it in practical situations. An advantage of a mathematics flipped classroom was that students who understand mathematical content are neither likely to guess nor memorise the subject but strive to understand. It is recommended that higher education institutions support the flipped classroom approach as well as assessment for learning and provide appropriate technology for positive outcomes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Traditional lectures have long been criticised for making students passive listeners instead of active participants. In spite of many strong arguments in favour of active learning most engineering courses are still based on lectures that only contain few elements of active learning. In flipped classroom teaching, traditional lectures are replaced by a combination of 1) on-line videos to be watched at home before the class and 2) classes dedicated almost entirely to active learning. A key advantage with the flipped classroom is that students can engage with the material at their own pace prior to the class such that class time can be dedicated to higher-level cognitive learning. However, even though the flipped classroom has received considerable attention over the past decade there are relatively few studies evaluating this pedagogical method in engineering education. In this case study, we report on the implementation and evaluation of the flipped classroom approach in a master's course on sensor fusion and nonlinear filtering at Chalmers. The course design was inspired by the 5E model (Bybee et al., 2006) in that we used the videos for engagement, exploration and explanation whereas the classroom sessions focused on elaboration and evaluation. The students' perceptions of the flipped classroom approach were probed through a survey containing both closed and open-ended questions. The vast majority of the students were either positive or very positive to the flipped classroom approach. For instance, 74% of the students strongly agreed with the statement that flipped classroom teaching leads to improved learning, 96 % stated that they preferred video lectures with quizzes to live lectures, and 87 % found the practice sessions useful. As the course contained both traditional lectures and flipped classes, we could compare how the two methods affected students' learning. From a teacher's perspective, flipping the classroom was both extremely rewarding and very demanding. Flipping the lectures required a significant amount of work, but when the material was developed, teaching was more stimulating and less demanding than in a traditional course. Although it was challenging to design the problems for the practice sessions, these sessions were the most exciting and rewarding parts of the course. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The use of Active Learning Spaces (ALS) combined with team-based learning (Fink, Michaelsen & Knight, 2004) has been successfully used in initiatives such as TEAL (Technology Enhanced Active Learning) and SCALE-UP (Baepler, Brooks & Walker, 2014). This approach has proved popular in North America, and has attracted growing interest in the UK. The key benefits demonstrated have been improvements in: class attendance; retention rates; levels of conceptual understanding; pace of learning (Beichner, Saul, Abbott, et al., 2007). This ongoing comparative study set out to establish the key drivers and barriers to the development of ALS and the future landscape for classroom pedagogies that are being adopted within these innovative spaces. A mixed methodology has been adopted to triangulate the needs, expectations and opinions of three key stakeholders: students, academics, and policy makers. A series of focus group interviews were conducted with students and lecturers, and an online questionnaire completed by senior managers representing a range of UK Higher Education Institutions. The analysis of the results so far point to a burgeoning awareness amongst students and staff of the positive educational impact of newer pedagogies such as the 'flipped classroom' and 'inquiry based learning', alongside an intensifying impatience with the status quo. From the institutional perspective, aside from the financial implications, a formidable hurdle is the pressure on physical space, and thus, room occupancy rates. ALS typically reduce room occupancy by 25-30%, however previous studies have indicated attendance at lectures rarely exceed 60% of the cohort (Dobkin, Gil & Marion, 2007), and a recent evaluation of learning spaces at one HEI demonstrated a room utilization rate of just 27%. There is now a clear rationale for the creation of teaching spaces that effectively support technology enhanced pedagogies which attract, engage and retain students across the whole academic cycle. In this paper we will discuss the current results of our study in relation to critical questions around ALS and the flipped classroom, and more broadly the strategic decisions around estate management versus the demands and expectations of students and staff. © 2016. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The new generation of engineering students has grown up within the new technologies which provide opportunities like internet, smart phone environment and applications on such environment which also affects how they learn. We are starting to re-think how to teach students in this new generation, how students gain knowledge through videos before class, and how instructors guide students to clarify and apply that knowledge during class in a flipped classroom. Recently, many events aimed to promote computer programming education for K-12 students worldwide. For example, President Barack Obama stated in the video for the 2013 Computer Science Education Week annual event: ?Don?t just buy a new video game - make one. Don?t just download the latest app - help design it. Don?t just play on your phone - program it.? A popular tool for teaching K-12 students computer programming is Scratch. Scratch, a visual programming environment, allows students to create their own personally meaningful interactive content (interactive stories, games, music and art). This study explored the effects of on-line self-learning and the validity of on-line peer assessment in high schools and to analyze effects of various types of peer feedback on students. Participants were 111 senior high school students enrolled in a Scratch programing course. Following procedure was performed during the class for 18 weeks: the students watched the on-line video materials, gave feedbacks, and formed 33 groups of three or four to create Scratch game projects, viewed other groups? work, and performed assessment on the Web-based learning and assessment system. The peer assessment activity consisted of three rounds. Pearson's correlation analysis was conducted and the results indicated: 1) students significantly improved their projects as involving the peer assessment activities; 2) the peer-assessment results and teacher assessment results were without significant differences, indicating that peer assessment in high school could be perceived as a valid assessment method; 3) the on-line video materials feedback and end-of-project final score were highly consistent. This study also examined the relationships between the types of peer feedbacks in which students obtained from peer assessment and the subsequent performance of their projects. Corrective peer feedback was useful in helping students? development of better projects. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Three sections of the introductory probability and statistics course were taught. This is a required course for civil, electrical, mechanical and bio-engineering majors in our school. The flipped approach was implemented in two sections; the third section was taught traditionally and will serve as a comparison. The "flipped" or "inverted" classroom is an instructional technique in which lecture is removed from class time and replaced with more active instructional opportunities. Students practice their skills during class time and can receive individualized help from the instructor or TA as needed, versus passively taking notes while the instructor teaches the concepts. The flipped classroom approach shifts instruction from passive to more active and allows the instructor to include problem solving elements while still covering necessary material. It provides greater opportunities for integrating higher order cognitive skills in the classroom and better structures students' out-of-class time. In the literature, we found implementations of the flipped classroom in other undergraduate statistics classrooms, and these flipped classrooms were associated with significant improvements in both direct measures of student learning as well as measures of the classroom environment. Our class materials, including lecture notes, class activities, homework assignments and quizzes, were modified in order to implement the flipped classroom pilot during four weeks of the semester, or eight lecture periods. The remaining lectures were taught traditionally. As part of our program evaluation, the two flipped sections were observed for the degree of active learning, problem solving, and student engagement during class using a structured behavioral observation protocol known as the Teaching Dimensions Observation Protocol (TDOP). Several of the traditionally-taught class sessions were also observed for comparison, with positive results noted. Also, a comparison of students' conceptual and exam performance in the two flipped sections versus the "traditional" section enabled direct assessment of the benefits of the new approach, with significant differences not being detected. Further assessment of the flipped "pilot" classroom included student engagement, instructors' reflections, and two perception instruments measuring students' overall experience in the class. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Department of Engineering and Design at Western Washington University has implemented a blended learning methodology in its introductory Computer-Aided Design course. This methodology improves learning using a combination of techniques which improve the efficiency of delivery of course content while maximizing value-added student activities where interactions with the instructor and TAs are prized. These techniques include a "flipped classroom" model, on-line video instructional materials, efficient content modularization and customizability, automated feedback, integrated assessment mechanisms and team-based in-class activities. A high proportion of class time is structured to support creative project work where students appropriate CAD skills by applying them to creative problem solving. It is the opinion of the authors that this blended learning methodology has the potential to provide a just-in-time delivery of instruction which can be customized to meet an individual student's need. While traditional assessment techniques are designed to measure student course outcomes, they do little to measure the efficiency of instruction. Since there is an undeniable connection between the delivery mechanism and how well a student learns, it can be postulated that the ability to measure the performance of this mechanism and to adjust this in a systematic way, needs to be an integral part of any strategy for improving student learning. In this paper we present a perspective that looks to the body of work in Lean Manufacturing to provide a framework for better understanding the performance of the blended learning mechanism we have adopted. The Toyota Production System (TPS) is one view of Lean Manufacturing. Amongst other concepts, it identifies Muda (unnecessary work), Muri (overburden) and Mura (unevenness) as the three contributors to waste in manufacturing. The goal of Lean Manufacturing is to control and ultimately eliminate these three sources of waste. This view of manufacturing can be applied to an instructional environment. For example, Muda can manifest itself in repetitive instruction needed to keep students with different learning abilities in step. Muri can result from increasing class sizes where the instructor and TA are spread thin in their coverage of student needs. And, Mura can be created by the traditional approach to instruction where it is available only at scheduled times and in a specific location. Mitigating these inefficiencies can be viewed as developing a Lean Education philosophy in the same way that lean principles have been applied to other disciplines outside of manufacturing such as in the health care, construction, distribution and service industries. This paper will review the mechanisms of a blended learning approach developed for this introductory CAD course. Each activity performed and technique used by the instructor, TAs and students will be described and categorized in terms of lean principles such as the three discussed in the previous paragraph. This will show that new approaches to education such as blended learning have the potential to be organized and managed using a Lean Education framework that is analogous to the one for manufacturing. Further, the authors will present several ideas on how using this perspective on instruction can be used to benefit when developing and running a course adapted to the blended learning philosophy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Many courses across the curriculum in secondary and post-secondary education are moving to the so-called "flipped" classroom. In the "flipped" classroom model students survey the course content online before class then class time is spent discussing and solving problems with the guidance of the instructor. The theory of the "flipped" classroom is that students are actively engaged during class with the instructor and other students, thus increasing comprehension of the course material. This paper considers a "flipped" classroom in a university calculus-based engineering statics course. The specific structure of this class was to place recorded videos of lectures, as well as videos of solved problems, online for students to view prior to attending class. Class time was then devoted to a combination of instructor-guided problem solving as well as student-led problem solving. The intention of this approach was to move the concept derivations (which students often discount) out of class time and replace it with more example problems that students directly work to solve with instructor support. The expectation is that students will have more confidence and success in solving statics problems in the future. This research considered in this paper occurred over the course of two semesters with two distinct groups of students. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments were completed during both semesters including student performance on Fundamentals of Engineering exam questions, student surveys, and instructor observations. Modifications were made to the delivery of the course both mid-semester and between semesters based on the results of these assessments. The results of these assessments, as well as the ultimate framework of course, are detailed in this paper. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the flipped classroom model, students are assigned to read material or view videos on class topics before coming to class. The traditional lecture period can then be used to engage students via a variety of methods including active learning techniques such as peer instruction, labs, and problem sets. Cited advantages of this pedagogical method include, amongst others: time to spend with student on authentic research, time to work with scientific equipment in classrooms lecture content can be viewed repeatedly, the method promotes thinking both inside and outside of the classroom, and students are more actively involved in the learning process. All of these advantages share a common philosophy; online instruction can be used at home to free class time for learning. This paper presents the implementation, delivery, and analysis of a flipped course in electrical power engineering technology at the undergraduate level. The methods used are characterized in terms of existing evidence based research for practical and effective instruction, and instructor and student feedback is included for comparison. First, a method of converting the traditional lecture based instructional content into web-based videos using a low-cost do-it-yourself smart board is presented, as well as the organization of video content into online playlists for ease of viewing. Second, methods of monitoring student completion of out-of-class assignments are evaluated, and the use of low-stakes online quizzes is presented as such a tool. The restructuring of class time is then discussed, including the use of deep learning activities, problem based learning, peer instruction, laboratory based learning, and traditional problem sets. The paper is concluded with a summary of reports on student's perceptions of the flipped methodology. Throughout the paper, both the benefits and the pitfalls of the flipped classroom method are highlighted, and the importance of proper instructional design is emphasized. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {At universities across the country, flipped classrooms are replacing traditional lectures for many fundamental engineering courses. Flipped classes often use short, lecture-style videos that students view before coming to class. Conventional wisdom in creating these videos says that it is better for the video to be of the actual course instructor rather than a video of someone else. The ubiquity of engineering statics courses across the country would therefore require many faculty at many institutions to make videos of the same material. In this study, faculty from North Carolina State University and Florida Institute of Technology have partnered to test the hypothesis that familiarity with the presenter in the video is optimal for student learning. Engineering Statics courses at NC State have been flipped for several years. The videos produced at NC State have been used in a newly flipped classroom at Florida Tech. For two modules, new videos of identical content were produced featuring the instructor of the newly flipped class. The first group of students saw the NC State videos for all but Module One, wherein they viewed the local professor's videos. The second group of students saw the Florida Tech videos for all but Module Two. To determine if there were differences in performance between students who viewed course videos by the local professor and students who viewed the non-local professor, scores on various assessment tools were analyzed using the ANOVA procedure. This study did not find a significant difference in academic performance between students who viewed videos featuring their classroom professor and students who were instead exposed to a non-local professor. Additionally, an end of course survey revealed that in general students had no preference for who was featured in the videos. Further refinement of the class materials management system and the inclusion of additional course modules are opportunities to improve and further validate this study. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Western Carolina University is the only educational institution that offers engineering and technology degrees in the western part of the state which is home to major national and international engineering-related companies. As the power industry has a significant share among these companies and is becoming one of the major recruiters of our graduates in the Department of Engineering and Technology at Western Carolina University, developing an emphasis in electric power engineering plays a vital role in educating the next generation of the region's power industry workforce. To that end, a curriculum development effort was planned and is projected to train, prepare for research, and educate the students enrolled in the Department of Engineering and Technology for careers in the power industry. The curriculum includes three fundamental power engineering courses: 1. Electric Power Systems 2. Power Electronics 3. Electrical Machines and Drives The first two courses have been developed and implemented under the guidance of the Consortium of Universities for Sustainable Power (CUSP™) at University of Minnesota. This paper describes in detail the first two pilot implementations of the Power Electronics course for Electrical Engineering (EE) undergraduates and presents its assessment results. The pedagogical concept that was used is called "Flipped Classroom Pedagogy" in which active student engagement is facilitated through on-line pre-recorded lectures. To enhance this concept, a hybrid approach to the traditional lecture was applied. In this approach, students are exposed to both on-line and face-to-face lecture methods. In addition, this approach included a short online quiz through Blackboard™ before each course module and a short quiz at the start of class session after each course module to improve student participation. In fact, a 2010 U.S. Department of Education report<sup>1</sup> concluded that "Instruction combining online and face-to-face elements had a larger advantage relative to purely face-to-face instruction than did purely online instruction". However this report targeted very broad population including K-12, career technology, medical and higher education, as well as corporate and military training. In addition, many studies in this report did not attempt to equate (a) all the curriculum materials, (b) aspects of pedagogy and (c) learning time in the treatment and control conditions. Therefore, the study presented in this paper is unique in a sense that the analysis is only for electrical engineering students based on specific curriculum contents and hybrid flipped classroom pedagogy where online and in-class lecture components present. End of year survey data of two consecutive year course offerings were collected to evaluate the overall course and the faculty performance as well as the sustainability of the established course concept. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Graduates in chemical engineering pursue a wide variety of careers and, in today's business environment, technical proficiency is required but no longer sufficient to ensure success. Well-developed problem-solving skills and the ability to describe, convey, and sell those solutions to upper management is a must. The pace of business has also increased - higher productivity, shorter design turns, and global competition mean that successful engineers must be self-starters, seek out opportunities for improvements, and have an entrepreneurial mindset. Our current capstone design experience fails to fully prepare our graduates for these challenges. Currently, the course focuses on technical design skills, with light coverage of actual problem solving and design strategies or heuristics. As the first truly comprehensive chemical engineering course, the current content is a blend of a review of principles and some concepts of integration of skills. It is still delivered in a lecture-driven, teacher-centered format, and the communications component is heavily reliant on rather lengthy written reports. Our student teams do benefit from being mentored by program alumni working in industry, which provides an element of exposure to the real world, but overall the course may be summarized as a bit of creative effort followed by a great deal of computation and technical writing. Therefore, we revitalized the course with the goal to • focus more heavily on actual problem solving and design skills, • give students more practice and experience applying these skills with rapid feedback, • involve the students directly in problem generation and selection, and • shift the communications focus towards concise, business-oriented written and oral reporting. This redesign aimed to give students more input into the projects they work on and more empowerment in their own learning, and provide an opportunity for dedicating significant classroom time to active learning and peer-to-peer evaluation. In pursuing these overall goals, we also developed better tools for differentiating individualized student assessment, separate from team-based assessments, and are currently assessing any demonstrable improvement in addressing individual course outcomes as identified by ABET. This paper describes our approach to • develop the learning modules to deliver technical content to students on-demand, outside the classroom • create in-class activities to give students practice using creative problem-solving strategies, • redesign the problem development process to make it student-driven by engaging and empowering students to define and select a worthwhile problem, and • develop assessment tools to evaluate the new course design's impact on student skills, as compared to the traditional approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents data using several methods of assessing student performance with the new inverted classroom methodology in juxtaposition to the traditional method of delivery. The implemented changes have streamlined course contents and noticeably improved student understanding of the covered material. The pilot course is a three credit, 200 level engineering class which aims to teach students the tools for problem solving, graphing and analyzing engineering data, programming of formulae, and procedures. This class uses Excel and Matlab as the software to implement these tools, and approximately twenty chapters are covered within two different textbooks. The following changes have been implemented in this software-based course: First, the structure of the class was modified. Initially, Excel was taught at the beginning of the semester and Matlab in the second part. This structure did not allow for an effective way of comparing the tools between Excel and Matlab. Currently, the class is taught by topics. In addition, the assignments were modified to follow the new structure. Problems are taken from each book and then combined so students can follow the same methodology as in the class. The next change was to modify the method of homework collection. Initially, homework was collected via email and the student received feedback in writing. It was observed that in many cases that the student neither reviewed their errors nor the provided feedback. Now the assignments are revised by the instructor in each student's computer which allows immediate feedback. The final change was to modify the classroom teaching technique. The "flipped" or inverted classroom model was used. This recent pedagogical strategy has received much attention, as lectures are now delivered via computer videos and watched at the student's leisure while class time is spent with the instructor assisting in problem-solving activities. This method has also allowed more class time for the instructor to interact one-on-one with each student. Implementation and assessment data for a pilot class which uses all these changes is presented. The results show a positive improvement in the student outcome compared to previous offerings of this course. In addition, a series of surveys were distributed to obtain feedback and observations from the previous and current students. In general, the findings show that the current methodology can be expanded to other classes throughout the curriculum. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom approach has been one of the hottest topics among faculty and students for engineering education. Some like it and believe that it could be one of the best teaching methods because it increases the interaction between faculty and students, and focuses on problem solving. However some faculty and students dislike the approach because they believe that direct interactive lecturing in the traditional classroom approach is more effective. In order to test the flipped classroom approach, we chose one chapter of engineering dynamics and tried the flipped classroom approach in the summer of 2014. At the end of the experiment, a student survey was utilized to collect students' feedback. This paper presents our experiment with the flipped classroom approach, including preparation, execution, survey results, observations and findings. One interesting observation from this trial was that students with higher grades in the traditional classroom approach liked the flipped classroom approach and students with mediocre grades or lower in the traditional classroom approach disliked the flipped classroom approach. For the faculty without funding support and faculty teaching relief, a partial flipped class is a starting point in order to try the flipped classroom approach. With a partial flipped class, both faculty and students could still test the approach and had much deeper understanding of the approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Studies show that student-centered instruction can be more effective than teacher-centered. Here, we investigated achievement, persistence, and attitude regarding several student-centered strategies in a one-credit, large-scale, statistics and design of experiment course for upper-division biomedical engineering (BME) undergraduates. More specifically, we asked "What is the effect of the flipped classroom, pencasts/online lectures, cyber-based muddiest point (unclear concept) collection, and group-based activities on attitude, achievement, and persistence?" Two components comprised the course. Prior to class, students watched pencasts, submitted the muddiest and most interesting points online, and completed practice problems. In class, students engaged in a review of the muddiest/most unclear points in class and then applied lecture material through group activities including statistical software-oriented problem solving sessions and design projects with the support of undergraduate teaching assistants and the instructor. To evaluate these student-centered strategies, three aspects were considered: persistence, attitude, and achievement. Persistence was measured as the number of students present during the second week of class and remaining at the final. To measure student value and attitude, two validated, custom surveys were administered in the middle and at the end of the semester anonymously: 1) the Student Value Survey on Muddiest Points (SVM) which focused on interest and usefulness as well as cost (emotion, time, effort) related to muddiest point collection and 2) the BME Student-centered Strategies (BSS) Survey regarding the flipped classroom, pencasts, muddiest points, and group activities. Lastly, most recently, a ten-question concept quiz was created and piloted to assess achievement related to key statistical and design of experiment concepts. Persistence tracked for three semesters showed a value of greater than 98%. Student attitude surveys completed during the same time frame also showed positive outcomes, supporting the notion of high self-efficacy. Briefly, with respect to the SVM, the majority of students (n=149) agreed with statements concerning value (94%), interest (62%), and cost (78%). According to the BSS survey, all engagement strategies were favorable with opinions of the pencast statistically higher than the rest of the interventions (0.9/1, n=132 students) and the flipped classroom statistically lower than the other interventions (0.69/1, n=132 students). In terms of achievement, pre-instruction data of the concept quiz yielded a score of 44% (n=82) for Fall 2014 and post-instructions scores were 75% for Spring 2014 (n=33) and 76% for Fall 2014 (n=49). Analysis of the fall paired data showed a large, statistically significant increase in conceptual understanding (n=37 pairs). In general, this multi-faceted, integrated assessment approach focusing on persistence, attitudinal, and achievement supported this unique instructional paradigm as an effective pedagogy for teaching and learning in the flipped classroom. Further, this work demonstrates that longitudinal tracking is an effective means for continuous improvement of course content and pedagogy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {One of the latest buzz words in engineering pedagogy is the concept of an inverted or "flipped" classroom. Students complete the lecture portion of the class on their own time by using video lessons prepared by the professor, and utilize the textbook and other materials as a study guide. Then, classroom time is dedicated to a more "hands-on" approach. Flipped classroom activities include guided, independent practice or lab work, and group-based interactive learning activities or inquiries. Is a flipped classroom a better instructional technique to enhance student learning? This research project will help solve this question by comparing two sections of a class in a statistically valid manner during the same semester. In the Fall of 2014, two sections of junior-level CVEN 3602 - Transportation Engineering were taught at the University of Colorado-Denver in the Civil Engineering Department. One of these sections is a traditional classroom, assigned to meet two days a week, at 1.25 hours each day. For a portion of the semester, this section was "flipped". The second section is an entirely on-line course. Student performance was measured throughout the semester. The two sections were compared with the exact same test material given on the same date. The research concentrates on the topic of geometric design (both vertical and horizontal curves). Both sections accessed the same video lectures, and were given the same materials for studying. During the non-flipped portion of the class, the on-line students performed better on the first exam, but worse on a second exam. The on-line section also performed better on Question Eight material on the comprehensive final (which covered non-flipped classroom material). Once the class was flipped, on-line quizzes were given before classroom time to better ensure students watched the video lectures. The quiz scores of the flipped classroom exceeded the online classroom in every topic. A majority of the comprehensive final tested the topics covered in the flipped classroom. Overall, the thirty students in the flipped classroom performed significantly better than the online classroom. For every question except Question Eight, the flipped class exceeded the mean of the on-line class. However, since these same thirty students didn't always score higher on previous exams in the course, it shows these students are not necessarily better test takers or higher performing students in general. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that the flipped classroom was more effective at conveying junior-level transportation engineering-related material. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The mathematical rigor of the course is surely not the reason? the requirements of understanding substance properties and of developing methodical problem-solving techniques, likely, are major causes. We have modified our teaching methods in this course to an inverted or flipped classroom that employed less formal instruction techniques than the traditional lecture. Our smaller class-sizes (typically less than 30) allow for direct instruction by the instructor and the peer mentor, group problem-solving, and other techniques. This paper discusses observed effectiveness of using non-lecture techniques compared to a lecture-based course. The results of lecture-based courses were observed over several years. The results are compared to results in non-lecture-based courses, taught by the same instructor, in two offerings in Fall 2012 and Fall 2014. The Thermodynamics Concept Inventory has been used as well as overall performance on quizzes, projects, and exams. Other qualitative observations are also discussed. Positive effects were previously observed in the non-lecture course compared to the lecture course and this paper discusses our most recent observations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, until recently more engineering educators have been involved with the implementation of various different educational and learning techniques. As part of this movement, this paper is aimed at analyzing and thereby assessing how different methods used in a flipped classroom setting will impact student-learning effectiveness. The study compares flipped classroom instruction to a traditional teaching method which is used as a reference for control study. Data gathered for the analysis is based on a non-biased uniformly distributed lab setting focused on using smart materials to determine the vibration frequency of a cantilever beam. The lab setup is a part of a Green Energy Materials & Engineering course offered in the summer 2014 semester. This class introduced students to the concepts of Green Manufacturing, Green Technologies in industries, and Fabricating advanced Green Energy devices. The framework used for gathering unbiased data, identifying a learning approach, and on quantifying the student learning is explained in detail. It is found that the instructional setting plays a significant role in flipped classroom learning effectiveness. Flipped classroom learning setup does not guarantee better learning effectiveness if not set up appropriately in a laboratory setting. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The use of technology that allows students to view lectures or concept modules outside the classroom has become popular in recent years. The most straightforward and accepted definition of a flipped-classroom was given by Lage, Platt, and Treglia "Inverting the classroom means that events that have traditionally taken place inside the classroom now take place outside the classroom and vice versa"<sup>1</sup>. While many professors and instructors have taken the approach to completely flip the classroom, where the lectures are recorded and the classroom activities are practice problems and perhaps group learning, this paper presents a hybrid approach. Researchers have pointed out that students prefer in-person lectures to video lectures but also prefer interactive activity-based classes to lectures.<sup>2,3</sup> Therefore, the authors of this paper chose to implement and assess a hybrid approach to the flipped-classroom model. Approximately 40% of the lectures were recorded affording time for in-class time problem solving and class discussions of problem solving approaches. The balance of the lecture time was allocated for a traditional lecture style. The time spent in lecture, however, was not a traditional lecture approach. The lectures were interactive where students were required to participate in the problem solving. The lecture classes were small enough, no more than 32 students per classroom, to allow for instructor-student interaction. This paper presents a detailed discussion of the course delivery - how the classroom time was allocated, how the laboratory time was allocated, and how technology was utilized. A comprehensive summative survey was voluntarily completed by the students. The results of this survey will be discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore relationships between teaching methods and students' learning and satisfaction in statics courses. This study explored the teaching methods that were used in sophomore-level statics courses taught by three different instructors. The teaching methods ranged from fairly standard lecture with numerous example problems worked during class to flipped class that was highly interactive. Faculty interviews and student focus groups provided insight into the course from both perspectives. Students took a statics concept inventory to gauge topic-based knowledge as well as a separate self-assessment of their learning gains. Results show no clear link between instructional methods and student understanding of statics concepts but do show a student preference for the more active, student-centered classrooms. Faculty member interviews showed a trend toward teaching based on personal philosophy of how their efforts will affect student learning. These preliminary results serve as initial insight into faculty and student perspectives of the engineering science courses that are typical of the sophomore year in engineering. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

These subjects are taking a central role in promoting active learning in our college. In 2013, we introduced ICT-driven equipment into the laboratory classrooms of physics, chemistry and applied physics. By implementing this equipment, we are practicing active learning (flipped learning). Traditional flipped learning applied at home and abroad is based on the classroom lecture. On the other hand, from the standpoint that the education of Colleges of Technology is characterized by practical science, our college has created the environment for a new type of active learning (flipped learning) where classroom lectures and experimental practices are combined. In some cases of flipped learning, students use study materials written in English for preparation. And so, our college is promoting the teaching of English related to engineering as well. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Many University lecturers in Germany face the challenge of teaching very large classes, sometimes including 1000 or even more students. They often have to cope with a very high level of noise, bad room conditions, an extremely low level of participation as well as interaction and feedback. Some lecturers therefore try to overcome these challenges by using technology in their classroom. Previous research has already focused on evaluating the use of audience response systems (ARS) in a traditional but very large engineering lecture. This sort of technology has proven to be an effective tool in order to e.g. increase student motivation, give them additional support in the learning process and on the other hand give the lecturer feedback about the students' learning progress as well as possible crucial points of the lecture. This paper, however, goes one step further. It analyzes the use of ARS in a flipped classroom setting of a large engineering lecture for first-year-students. After having completed almost two thirds of the flipped classroom lecture, students were being questioned about their experiences and opinions about the use of ARS in this particular educational setting. The standardized questionnaire included questions issuing e.g. comprehension, motivation, frequency, enjoyment, interaction, involvement as well as usability aspects. First results show that e.g. The majority of the students feel that clicker questions foster their comprehension, motivate them to be attentive and increase the quality of the lecture. When comparing the results to findings from previous research in a traditional lecture, however, one thing becomes apparent: The evaluation of the use of ARS in the in a flipped classroom setting has turned out to be slightly less positive than that of the traditional lecture. This finding will be particularly discussed and may even call for further research in the designated field of interest. In a first step, the lecture itself will be described considering content, background and general settings. Subsequently, the survey instrument and methodology will be presented. In a third step, the results of the survey will be presented and discussed. Finally, further research fields will be identified. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Using the same course content, student end of course opinion surveys were compared for a traditional lecture (n = 23) and flipped digital circuits engineering class (n = 29). In particular, three items from the student opinion survey were of interest: instructor's teaching helped me learn, accessible to students, and organized course well. It was predicted that student ratings would be more positive on each of the three identified end of course opinion survey items for the flipped class compared to its traditional lecture counterpart. Results supported the study's prediction in addition to providing supplemental findings for the future use of the flipped classroom in engineering and otherSTEMcourses. The multiple benefits of the flipped class pedagogical strategy are discussed with respect to future implementations for faculty teaching STEM courses. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Engineering students benefit from an active and interactive classroom environment where they can be guided through the problem solving process. Typically faculty members spend class time presenting the technical content required to solve problems, leaving students to apply this knowledge and problem solve on their own at home. There has recently been a surge of the flipped, or inverted, classroom where the technical content is delivered via online videos before class. Students then come to class prepared to actively apply this knowledge to solve problems or do other activities. In this paper, recommendations are made for applying this educational technique to large engineering classrooms. These recommendations are based both on a literature review of flipped classes and the evaluation of a case study of a large Introduction to Environmental Engineering class. The case study evolved from a traditional lecture-based classroom through two different versions of a flipped classroom. Evaluation of students' interaction, preferences and performance are used to make recommendations about the video time, use of class time, course organization and student assessment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This new approach aims to facilitate an increasing interest from engineering students by motivating them to work the subject of Mathematics in their first university course. Within this approach each session is divided into three parts: preparation, solving doubts and assessment of the competences assigned to that session.

However, which video will best grab their attention? This research was conducted to investigate the best framework for learning using video among visual learners. In order to do so, three different videos embedded with Cognitive Load Theory were selected by researchers. Then, 23 students from varied faculties at University Technology Malaysia (UTM) were selected to answer the Visual, Audio and Kinaesthetic (VAK) Learning Style Test. Nine visual learners were then identified among these respondents and invited to answer the questionnaire on perception of learning using video based on cognitive load theory. Data were analyzed using qualitative measures and content analysis. The findings show that visual learners love videos with less than six minutes' duration, high definition visual quality, simple delivery language and a slow delivery method. All of the visual learners preferred to use video before entering class, which synchronizes with the flip classroom strategy. Hopefully, this framework can be used by educators to develop their own video-based learning materials. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The traditional lecture style of teaching has long been the norm in college science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses, but an innovative teaching model, facilitated by recent advances in technology, is gaining popularity across college campuses. This new model inverts or 'flips' the usual classroom paradigm, in that students learn initial course concepts outside of the classroom, while class time is reserved for more active problem-based learning and practice activities. While the flipped classroom model shows promise for improving STEM learning and increasing student interest in STEM fields, discussions to date of the model and its impact are more anecdotal than data driven - very little research has been undertaken to rigorously assess the potential effects on student learning that can result from the flipped classroom environment. This study involved 55 students in 2 sections of an applied linear algebra course, using the traditional lecture format in one section and the flipped classroom model in another. In the latter, students were expected to prepare for the class in some way, such as watching screencasts prepared by the instructor, or reading the textbook or the instructor's notes. Student content understanding and course perceptions were examined. Content understanding was measured by the performance on course exams, and students in the flipped classroom environment had a more significant increase between the sequential exams compared to the students in the traditional lecture section, while performing similarly in the final exam. Course perceptions were represented by an end-of-semester survey that indicated that the flipped classroom students were very positive about their experience in the course, and particularly appreciated the student collaboration and instructional video components. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flipping a classroom is an innovative teaching method in itself. This method faces additional challenges when the students are not actually engineering majors. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the development, implementation, and assessment of a flipped classroom for a thermal-fluids course for nonengineering majors. Problem solving is a critical component of engineering education; an engineering student cannot only read problem statements or solely attend a lecture. However, duration of student contact in the classroom is constrained by credit hours. In a local survey, most students indicated that they would not take the time to complete not-for-grade problems on their own after class. For many of these students, graded homework assignments are the first and only experience they have in solving complex engineering problems prior to exams. By only receiving lectures and struggling to work homework problems individually, it is arguable that few of these students are able to progress beyond the lower tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. Historical time survey data suggests that the students conduct little to no daily preparation when there are no graded requirements and conversely show extremely large time spikes when out of class assignments are due or prior to in-class evaluations. Finally, in-class lectures force an instructor to teach a certain amount of material in a limited timeframe irrespective of the rate at which each student can retain or comprehend that information regardless of the experience level of the student. Inspired by the pedagogical concept of 'flipping the classroom,' Khan Academy online instructional videos, and the Thayer Method (whereby students prepare prior to class, recite the topic to their instructors and receive daily evaluations) the authors created a blended course. This blended course leveraged the digital age through video lectures before class and combined it with traditional engineering problem solving in class. The goals of this blended course are as follows: improve the quality and efficiency of student learning by conducting lectures outside of class and homework during class; allow non-engineering students to learn each lesson's material at their own pace and provide a valuable study tool for exam preparation; increase the time spent in classroom solving problems with instructors; leverage one-on-one time in the classroom where the instructor can better approach each individual's issues; encourage and enable nonengineering students to take more responsibility for their learning and become lifelong learners; and inspire intellectual curiosity in the field of engineering. The instructors developed a preliminary beta test for the initial third of an undergraduate introductory course in thermal-fluid systems and kept the remainder of the course unchanged from its traditional lecture method to gain student feedback. This feedback was used to develop a completely blended course consisting of non-engineering majors; the results of which are studied and presented in this paper. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Learning using electronic tools has been studied for impacts on students since the calculator and typewriter were introduced into classrooms. The information systems field has been at the forefront of introducing IT artifacts into the classroom to enhance student learning outcomes. Research in IS has focused primarily on replacing a traditional classroom structure (synchronous time and place) with completely asynchronous learning approaches (Alavi, Marakas, & Yoo, 2002; Arbaugh & Benbunan- Finch, 2006; Santhanam, Sasidharan, & Webster, 2008). However, the approach that is gaining significant attention is that of a blended approach, where the class aims to incorporate both traditional and e-learning elements, leveraging the strengths of each. Indeed, Alavi and Leidner (2001) argue that technology mediated learning (TML) should not attempt to duplicate traditional learning approaches and thus the research should move toward "forming relationships among technology and relevant instructional, psychological, and environmental factors that will enhance learning outcomes." One of the most significant impacts that using a blended approach can have is to allow the professor to "flip" the classroom to enhance learning outcomes. Increasing the number of majors in IS and preparing our students at large (Granger, Dick, Luftman, Van Slyke, & Watson, 2007; Koch, Van Slyke, Watson, Wells, & Wilson, 2010) makes the development of compelling classroom experiences an imperative for IS professors globally. Leveraging the technological tools developed by practitioners in our field in a meaningful way in the classroom to promote active learning gives IS professors a slight advantage over other disciplines in incorporating active learning activities and thus effectively flipping the classroom. An added bonus for the professor when adopting a flipped classroom is a potentially more interesting academic experience. Lecturing the same introductory class multiple times over several years, even with rapidly changing course material, can lead to professor burnout and a lack of enthusiasm for the material. Implementing an effective flipped course leads to potentially better student outcomes in terms of learning and student satisfaction with the course, while giving the professor a potentially new course each delivery based on the choice of different active learning items implemented for the course. The primary research questions for this investigation center around student outcomes in terms of learning and course satisfaction in the IS discipline using IT tools. Our first question is "does flipping the classroom using IS/IT improve student outcomes?" and second, "does flipping the classroom using IT/IS impact student evaluations of the course?" Over the course of three semester-long course periods, data on student outcomes and satisfaction are analyzed to look at the differences between T<inf>1</inf>, where a lecture delivery method was used to teach an Introduction to IS course; T<inf>2</inf>, the initial flipped classroom delivery of the same material; and T<inf>3</inf>, the second flipped classroom delivery. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Pedogogical and technical advances, however, lead many to question whether lecture is the most effective way to educate students. At the same time, some instructors have begun investigating ways to use online learning technologies-such as screencasting or lecture capturing-to leverage the strengths of lecture. In this chapter, we describe the experience of one instructor ?flipping? her mathematics classroom by having students watch recorded lectures online prior to each class period. The benefits and challenges of learning in a flipped classroom environment are discussed, using data from a student survey, instructor reflections, and exam scores. In addition, the benefits of integrating online learning technologies into STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) coursework are included. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We are employing the "flipped classroom" teaching and learning approach in a required junior-level industrial engineering course on facility layout and material handling. In the "flipped classroom," students use out-of-class time to watch lectures available online. This frees class time for problem solving, active learning, or difficult topics, for which the instructor serves as an on-demand consultant or advisor. To prepare for flipping this class in the spring of 2014, the instructor conducted a pilot the previous spring by "flipping" three lecture periods. In a student evaluation of the pilot in which over 90% responded, nearly 65% preferred in-class problem solving to traditional lecture. Frequently-stated benefits were the in-class accessibility of the instructor and the ability to re-watch videos. The College and University Classroom Environment Inventory was administered both before the pilot and during the full classroom flip to measure changes in student perceptions, and significant differences in several dimensions closely related to the flipped classroom were observed. Also, using the Teaching Dimensions Observation Protocol, we observed an increase in active learning components within the flipped relative to the pre-flipped course, as strived for. The experiences of the instructor in flipping this IE course will also be discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Canada, as elsewhere, is experiencing a growing demand for accountability in the higher education sector, and universities are being pressured to provide evidence that they are preparing their graduates for the workforce. In Ontario, Canada's most populous province, the Ministry responsible for higher education has articulated the "essential employability skills" required for graduates; these include communication skills, critical thinking and problem solving skills, and interpersonal skills. Through accreditation requirements, professional programs in business, health sciences and engineering have developed graduate-level competencies and embedded them into their curriculum, but the emerging need to demonstrate these skills in graduates from traditional liberal arts and science disciplines, presents bigger challenges. Even if agreement can be reached about the specific qualities humanities graduates might need in the workplace, other questions remain. How can these skills be developed in subjects that lack clear practical applications? And how can skills be fostered when first-and second-year university courses often have very high enrolments and are commonly taught in large lecture format? This case study examines how the flipped classroom model is providing students with greater opportunities to develop employability skills in humanities and social science courses. Four high-enrolment, introductory courses-psychology, sociology, classics, and gender studies-have been redesigned from traditional lecture format into flipped classroom models with the goal of enhancing student engagement through active learning. By replacing some lecture time with online learning, the courses are able to focus face-to-face learning activities on group work, collaborative learning and the application of knowledge. The effectiveness of these course transformations is being examined through a longitudinal descriptive research study that examines whether students engage in their learning differently in flipped courses. Quantitative data was collected via student surveys in the last offerings of the traditional format courses and is being gathered with each flipped classroom offering, using the Student Class-Level Survey of Student Engagement (CLASSE). Independent sample T-tests of the data for each course show that average scores in the flippedformat courses are higher than in the traditional versions. Specifically, the majority of the courses show statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvements in areas associated with employability skills such as collaborative learning, writing skills and higher order thinking skills. The results of this research verify the importance of instructional strategies and course design in achieving the development of employability skills, and suggest that the flipped classroom model can enable this process. By examining the specific ways in which these courses were transformed in the light of the corresponding research results, this paper offers other institutions insights into how to promote the development of similar skills in courses the humanities and social sciences. The demand for institutions of higher education to demonstrate that their graduates have acquired employability skills is a relevant issue across the globe. While much of the discussion has been focused on professional disciplines, this paper presents insights and research into developing these skills in humanities and social sciences. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

New technologies fundamentally changed the way they interact with knowledge so the traditional approach to learning and teaching is no longer sufficient. In order to make the learning environment more interactive and enable students to learn easier and faster, modern teaching techniques need to be applied. There are many different teaching techniques that have emerged from the integration of technology in education such as: flipped teaching, whole brain teaching, gamification, social media, etc. Flipped teaching encourages students to study the course material before class by using readings, pre-recorded video lectures or research assignments. Class time is reserved for active learning strategies. Whole brain teaching helps stimulate both sides of the brain and emphasizes active learning in which students repeat core information and practice basic skills through humor and games. Gamification is a game-based learning technique that allows students learning through the use of games. Nowadays students are always connected to some social network. These students are easily motivated to engage with social media in the classroom. Experience from the School of Electrical Engineering in Zagreb shows that the use of different modern teaching techniques is making learning interesting and teaching more effective. © 2014 MIPRO. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The Fall 2012 lectures were recorded, so that each group saw the same lectures. Student retention and test performance was significantly higher in the flipped course.

By delivering the lecture content of the design process using videos and other media, class time is freed up for concrete progress on a team's specific project with support of faculty. The first goal of this project is to create educational materials to transfer the delivery of content regarding the design process to an out-of-class environment and to develop in-class active learning modules that clarify, elaborate, and expand on critical design process topics. These materials will be widely available for others to use. Currently, limited research exists on the impact of the flipped classroom model in engineering, mathematics, or science courses at the university level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to answer the engineering education research question: Are there differences in student performance in executing the engineering design process when comparing delivery of engineering design process knowledge using a lecture format versus a flipped classroom model? The change in format and the engineering education research question will be assessed by evaluating student performance. In addition, the quality and usability of the developed materials will be assessed by students and faculty at Rice University and partner institutions. To date, the team has described and planned the work for 2014 and has started making videos. The team is seeking feedback on developing materials that will be helpful for the community teaching engineering design. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Engineering is a field marked by critical thinking, problem solving, and application of vast amounts of scientific and technical knowledge. College-level engineering courses often focus on learning scientific material and are challenged to provide an opportunity for students to apply this material or develop the above skills necessary for success in the field. Because of this disconnect, a teaching method known as the flipped classroom is gaining consideration and implementation in engineering classes as well as in classrooms of many levels and disciplines. In a flipped classroom, live class lectures are moved out of classroom and replaced with on-line videos, and active, project-based learning activities are done in their place. At the University of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania State University two sustainable engineering courses focused on residential energy efficiency were flipped, and the impact this method had on the students was investigated. For this study, data was collected using pre- And post-confidence tests, a final course reflection survey, and the College and University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI). This data was then analyzed and used to develop conclusions on the students' perception of the flipped classroom teaching method and the course. Students in both courses frequently expressed that they learned various personal skills such as leadership, listening, and communication, which were consistent with class objectives. The tones of the student responses were positive, and on the CUCEI, the students scored the class environment above average. The highest scoring section of the CUCEI, 4 out of 5, was Personalization, which includes professor availability and highlights how a flipped classroom provides students with more opportunity to interact and connect personally with the teacher. As expected, the Involvement section, pertaining to student participation in in-class activities and class discussions, also scored high at 3.94 out of 5. Student comments were generally positive such as, "It was great that there was always time in class to ask about the module and topics I didn't understand," or, "I thought it created a more comfortable learning environment in class and allowed students to learn in their own way at home." Our findings suggest that the flipped classroom was a successful teaching method for these sustainable engineering courses. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This NSF TUES Grant # DUE-1140109 is conducting educational research to evaluate the use of case study based laboratory modules that enhance the learning experience in a junior level Environmental Engineering Laboratory course. The work investigates the use of the case studies in a lab course to introduce sustainability and environmental engineering laboratory concepts to 21st century learners using a modified-flipped classroom method. A total of four case studies have been developed and implemented into the course since the grant award. Before class, the students are given a case story related to the class experiment and asked to research the topic. The in-person lab class starts with a discussion of the case and the student's research finding. Students then conduct the lab exercise. Pre and post survey data indicated increased self-efficacy for ABET criteria skills and learning gains. Feedback from the student interviews suggested they felt the case studies methods used in the course were more engaging compared to their traditional laboratory classes they had taken during their education. The students particularly enjoyed the real world approaches and seeing how they could expect to apply course lab skills to their real jobs after graduation. This poster will summarize the cases, present preand post- survey data related to student learning preferences and the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) learning objective criteria, and will be used as a tool to help recruit other laboratory professors who are interested in using this method. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper describes two aspects of an ongoing faculty development model that uses small interactive teaching development groups. We used the model with engineering faculty at five institutions. The groups focused their work on the design and implementation of research-based, interactive teaching strategies. The focus of this work is using ongoing faculty development as a means to broaden the use of research-proven instructional practices in engineering courses. Jamieson and Lohmann explain the need for pedagogical research to connect with the needs of instructors 1. There is a long-standing gap between research about interactive teaching strategies and the implementation of those strategies in classrooms. In our project, we attempted to bring research-based practices into classrooms via small groups of instructors working on interactive teaching. Interactive teaching, for our purposes, can include almost any strategy that can support instructors shifting from only lecturing toward including more active participation in class sessions. For example, having students solve problems in class is a strategy increasing in prominence with the advent of the "flipped" classroom where students may watch video of lectures outside of class time. Using less technology, interactive teaching could also include pausing the lecture for students to solve problems on their own or in small groups in class. This is consistent with models for learning that emphasize that students need to learn facts, algorithms and procedures as well as higher order thinking and problem solving at a conceptual level 2. We recognize that these shifts in format may be challenging for instructors who do not have models for interactive instruction in their own background as learners or as teachers. In addition, it is challenging to know where to start when creating a more interactive classroom even when the benefits may be evident in terms of students' learning and overall experience. It is especially difficult without support from colleagues in the department who can share their successes and challenges with interactive teaching. In this paper, we focus on two characteristics of small teaching development groups that can support successful use of interactive teaching strategies. The first is scaffolding the groups' discussion with outside resources (e.g., books and videos) and organization by a facilitator. The second characteristic is balancing the external resources with a focus on the needs of participants and having needs-driven participation in the group. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {At the University of Cincinnati, three common courses were introduced during the 2012-2013 school year to provide first-year students with hands-on experiences in engineering and a link between engineering and the required mathematics and science courses. Two of these courses, Engineering Models I and II, form a two-semester sequence of interdisciplinary courses in which students apply fundamental theory from algebra, trigonometry, calculus and physics to relevant engineering applications chosen from a variety of disciplines. MATLAB® is introduced and progressively developed as a programming tool to enable students to explore engineering concepts, to investigate solutions to problems too complex for hand solutions, to analyze and present data effectively, and to develop an appreciation of the power and limitations of computer tools. The Engineering Models sequence was required for all incoming first-year engineering and engineering technology students in 2012-2013. There were multiples sections of these courses with twelve different instructors. Common power-point presentations were provided for lecture. A student survey administered at the end of the sequence revealed that about half of the professors added in-class demonstrations using MATLAB® during lecture while the other half simply read from the power-point slides. Students indicated that it would have been beneficial to spend more time in lecture learning to use MATLAB® to solve problems prior to attending recitation. This year, 2013-2014, a flipped pedagogy is being implemented in the Engineering Models I and II courses. This paper focuses on the effect of the flipped pedagogy on student performance and on student attitudes toward an inverted classroom. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There are a number of challenges in the development of first year inter-faculty engineering "cornerstone" design courses, not least of which is the need to integrate engineering fundamentals (theory) with engaging authentic team-based design (practice). Achieving this integration requires deliberate alignment of fundamentals to what can be wide variations in both academic and student conceptions of discipline. Within a course, integration must be achieved such that concepts are constructively aligned to the downstream artefacts of multiple hands-on design projects to avoid being interpreted as additional material to be learned but irrelevant to major assessment goals. A further challenge in an environment of ever-increasing class sizes is the development of an approach that allows for scale-up, yet also ensures students actually achieve requisite theoretical knowledge, professional ability, and behavioural learning outcomes. A large scale (1200 students) Flipped Classroom (FC) second-semester first-year engineering compulsory course was designed, implemented, operated and evaluated at a leading researchintensive university in Australia over the past 3 years to address these challenges. The FC model, where material is delivered online allowing face-to-face interactions to be grounded in authentic disciplinary practices, aligned with the need for scale-up. Integrating theory with practice in this way is necessary to drive deeper conceptual understanding of engineering fundamentals2, 9. This paper will elaborate on the curriculum design rationale for this course, its implementation, and the results of the extensive and ongoing evaluation. The methods and process detailed in the paper can be used to aid similar processes. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Most lectures were delivered in short online videos. Each class began with a brief review lecture and students spent most of the remaining class time solving problems in groups. Compared to the Spring 2012 offering, the same material was covered in less time and test scores on a common final exam increased. This paper summarizes the lessons-learned by teaching ISYE 330 as a flipped class. Class organization is contrasted with earlier versions of the course. The preparation of online and supplementary materials is described including a discussion of the evolution of the materials as the semester progressed. Student performance is analyzed and compared to previous offerings. Course evaluations are examined to gain insight into student attitudes to flipped classes. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of using the flipped strategy are summarized along with suggestions for how class could be changed in the future to make even more effective use of class time and enhance student learning. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The pedagogical literature has consistently and repeatedly shown that active learning is more effective than passive learning in teaching students fundamental engineering concepts, yet the lecture persists as the primary method of classroom organization for the vast majority of professors. Even among those professors who have read the literature and are willing to change their teaching methods, a barrier to adoption of active learning strategies is the time and effort required to develop the classroom activities for a particular course. This paper describes a series of experiments that can be done in class with low-cost equipment in an introductory circuits course. In each class period, a brief lecture at the beginning of the course went over the relative circuit theory, such as Ohm's Law and Kirchoff's laws. Then the instructor worked out a numerical example for a given circuit. Finally the students are instructed to build a circuit corresponding the example problem and make the necessary measurements to verify the theory. The class was divided into teams of four students each, and each team was given an equipment pack during the first week of class. The equipment packs included a budget digital multimeter (DMM), a number of resistors, a capacitor, LED, hobby-size DC motor, 9V battery, and lead wires with alligator clips for connecting the components. Students were instructed to bring the equipment packs to class every day, and they were also given homework assignments that required the use of the equipment packs. Though some breakage will occur and batteries may be accidentally discharged, the equipment packs can be re-used from year to year. Once the initial investment has been made, further upgrades with additional components can also be done in subsequent years. This paper contains a complete list of experiments that can easily be implemented by other instructors, and is also suitable for use in "flipped" classrooms. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A student passage rate from 65% to above 90% requires student grade improvement of twosigma. The different components of active learning techniques and the percentage of their additive standard deviations were considered over the past four semesters in an "Introduction to Circuit Analysis" course at San José State University (SJSU) to achieve such a result. A blended model of learning by merging content from an online MOOC with in-class, team-based instruction as part of a required undergraduate circuit theory course was implemented in the Fall 2012 semester and is ongoing at our university. The central objective of this pilot was to examine how adaptation and later adoption of the new MIT edX 6.002x (Electronics and Circuits) MOOC content in a flipped model of teaching might improve student learning in a credit-bearing college course. Multiple objectives for this pilot included: to improve the department's typical passage rate of 59% for this course; to improve students' retention rate; to shorten students' time-todegree; to improve the quality of the content of the course; and to reduce the prerequisite contribution for successful passage of subsequent courses. Student pass rates from the blended learning model Fall 2012 pilot jumped to 91%, as compared to a 59% passage rate from the previous year's traditional face-to face lecture class. Fall semester 2012 flipped classroom instruction was augmented with enhanced content and problem-based learning in Spring 2013, resulting in a passage rate of 87%, while the content of the course nearly doubled. For Fall 2013, an in-class laboratory segment using National Instruments myDAQ was added to the Spring 2013 version of the course to include the hands-on approach. The passage rate of 91% was achieved. It appears that adaptation of high quality MOOC content using a blended approach in conjunction with a highly structured, in-class team-based, problem-based and hands-on approach can produce significant benefits in effectively improving student learning and success. This study provides stratagem with different components for faculty to select from, which allows them to achieve the 2 sigma improvement in their students' grades. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Here, we investigate student persistence and attitude regarding several studentcentered strategies in a one-hour per week statistics and design of experiment course for upperdivision biomedical engineering (BME) undergraduates. More specifically, we ask "What is the effect of the flipped classroom, pencasts (online lectures), cyber-based muddiest point (unclear concept) collection, and group-based activities on student attitude and persistence?" The organization of classes is as follows: students watch pencasts outside of class, submit the muddiest and most interesting points online, engage in a review of the muddiest/most unclear points in class, and then apply the lecture material in- And out-of- class using group activities. Two surveys were administered anonymously to discern student value and attitude regarding these strategies: 1) the validated Student Value Survey on Muddiest Points (SVM) which focuses on interest and usefulness as well as cost (emotion, time, effort) related to muddiest point collection and 2) a new survey called the BME Student-centered Strategies (BSS) Survey regarding the flipped classroom, pencasts, muddiest points, and group activities. Survey analyses on the pilot data showed that the BSS was a valid and reliable survey. Preliminary analysis showed positive student attitude with respect to value, interest, and cost. Overall, both the persistence and survey data support this unique instructional paradigm as an effective pedagogy for teaching and learning in the flipped classroom. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Screencasts are short videos (typically less than 10 minutes) with narration and are made by digital capture of a tablet PC screen. Screencasts can introduce a topic, solve an example problem, explain a concept, explain a diagram and process, demonstrate software use, review for an exam, or present a mini-lecture. They can be used in combination with textbooks, online reading quizzes, homework assignments, and office hours. They can also be used to create flipped classrooms, where students work under the supervision of the instructor during class and information delivery is outside of class. Their brevity is an important attribute that distinguishes them from video lectures, and they have significant advantages that supplement textbooks and written materials. This personalized method of learning empowers students by giving them control over the rate of information delivery and when they receive information. As of December 2013, these videos were watched/downloaded over 3.2 million times, and they have received an overwhelmingly-positive response from students in our classes and from YouTube viewers. These screencasts are in the process of being validated by chemical engineering faculty. We are also assessing their effectiveness in improving student learning gains and attitudes. Previous research by others showed that screencasts help minimize cognitive overload, increase student confidence, and allow students to take control of their learning. They allow faculty to use class time for active-learning approaches, which are more effective than lectures. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The benefits of active learning have been demonstrated in recent research. Still, instructors of courses particularly in engineering hesitate in adopting such methods, teaching assistants included. This paper discusses an online survey sent to teaching assistants within the mechanical engineering department at a research university where information was collected regarding perspectives and practice of non- Traditional teaching techniques. The survey contained eight items that included a mixture of selected response and open-ended response. Motivated by the outcomes of the survey, this paper then presents a variety of teaching activities tailored to overcome the barriers that teaching assistants face in incorporating diverse teaching methods. The 'tricks of the trade' that are selected require modest preparation and few resources that instructors can easily incorporate into the lecture to break up the pace, regain focus, and strengthen the amount of information retained. At institutions where a smaller discussion section supplements a large lecture, the reduced class size is ideal for a novice instructor to introduce unfamiliar teaching methods. The included techniques (pauses, think pair share, minute papers, effective questions, and a flipped review session) are specifically adapted for use in engineering courses and personal examples from the classroom are given. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom is widely regarded as an excellent approach to exploit the affordances of digital and on-line technologies to actively engage students and improve learning. The traditional lectures "covering" course content are moved to on-line videos accessible to students before the class meetings, with the class meeting times being devoted mostly to discussion and application of the new ideas, and other active learning tasks. The expectation has been that this will make the courses much more effective and students will be able to achieve the intended course outcomes to a much greater extent than in the traditional classroom. But the results have been disappointing. Although students find the flipped classroom engaging, student achievement of course learning outcomes, as reported by most researchers who have used the approach, has been roughly the same as in traditional classes. How do we tailor the flipped classroom to achieve its full potential? That is the question our workin- progress attempts to address. The thesis underlying our approach, based on classic work in the area of how people learn, is that it is not enough to have students watch the on-line videos before the class meeting. They should also engage in serious, structured discussions with other students, and thoughtfully consider ideas that may conflict with their own understanding of the topic in question both in order to help them develop a deeper understanding of the topic and in order to highlight problem areas that need further elaboration by the instructor. We discuss the theoretical basis behind the work, provide some details of the prototype implementation of an on-line tool that enables such structured discussions, and describe our plans for using it in an undergraduate course on software engineering and for assessing the approach. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {While a number of issues affect student success, an area of great concern is student retention. Studies have shown that students are more likely to stay in college if they have clear goals, are active learners, and are active participants in classroom activities. In other words, students learn more when they are intensely involved in their education and have opportunities to apply what they are learning. Students also benefit when they are engaged in the teaching and learning of their peers, such as group work, peer review, study groups, and peer teaching in and out of class. Flipping the classroom is a relatively new active learning technique that faculty at many institutions have incorporated in their teaching. In a flipped classroom, laboratory and in-class activities replace typical class-lectures. Lectures are normally delivered over some other medium such as video on-demand or podcasts. However, there is no specific model for flipped classrooms, it simply draws on such concepts as student engagement, hybrid course design, and course podcasting. This paper describes how the flipped classroom technique was incorporated into a three-credit electrical engineering course that met twice a week. This paper presents details about the course, discusses student survey results, and describes plans to improve the delivery of this and similar courses. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In an effort to reduce these hurdles and encourage more faculty to use these methods, we have created a digital, open- Access course package for two chemical engineering courses, thermodynamics and material and energy balances. These course packages can also be used as templates for faculty who want to develop other courses that are student-centric and involve active learning. Many of the resources within the package stem from our online inventory of over 1,400 ConcepTests and 1,000 screencasts. These encompass topics in core chemical engineering courses, but many topics are also common to other engineering disciplines (i.e., fluid mechanics, heat transfer, thermodynamics, material science, and computing). The course packages use Microsoft OneNote, which allows the user to centralize all materials in one document. These course packages contain ready- To-use class templates, suggested readings and screencasts for students to complete prior to class, in-class ConcepTests, homework problems, and exam questions. The materials are aligned to popular textbooks but allow flexibility because they can be easily rearranged to meet individual needs. Resources and guides on implementing the methods in a class are also provided. These resources provide literature, best practices, and suggestions on using the course materials. The objective is to make it easier for faculty to convert to active learning instruction and towards a flipped class, where most of the information delivery is outside of the classroom. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the findings on 'flipping the classroom' pedagogy for one selected topic in the Software Engineering module. A flipped classroom is a form of blended learning where the lecture is moved outside the classroom with the help of technology and learning activities are moved inside the classroom. The students typically watch instructional videos outside of the classroom but participate in learning activities with other students in class. This allows students to learn on their own time and pace outside class time while enabling the lecturer to enhance interaction, collaboration and higher-order thinking of students by monitoring individual learning and task performance. Our past experience has shown that using the traditional approach to teach software engineering, which is a heavily conceptual and theoretical subject, can be challenging. Against this backdrop, we have devised a flipped class room trial to let the students carry out the learning activities before coming to class where they then share and apply the knowledge during face-to-face lessons for more engaging learning experience. As this is an initial trial, the author has chosen a topic that is relatively easy to understand and with support of interesting videos readily available online. The purpose is to motivate the use of flipped classroom for appropriate topics taught in Software Engineering curriculum. © 2014 IEEE. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It remains a challenging field for many college students who then tend to go into other engineering applications. But this trend can be reversed by utilizing modern educational tools in a flipped class model that takes advantage of and optimizes both online delivery in concert with classroom activities. Specifically, the flipped classroom model allows for the use of graphical visualization of heat transfer (a phenomena that for the most part is outside our visual spectrum) in an online format and active learning exercises that engage students in the classroom.

	abstract = {While the use of technology has increased in education, much of that technology, such as use of PowerPoint, SmartBoards and use of the Internet, has been used in the same pedagogical approach, which is lecture in the class, followed by homework outside of the classroom. While student engagement through active learning has been demonstrated to enhance learning, one of the challenges to faculty is how to include these active learning methods while still trying to cover sufficient material. Over the last few years, the use of technology has opened up another instructional strategy, called flipping the classroom. In this strategy, students take on a greater responsibility for their learning, and lectures that would normally be given by the professor in the classroom are now available online. Therefore, the classroom time can be used to engage students in problem solving activities, while the professor acts more like a facilitator of learning rather than a lecturer. In a four year Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology program, one of the sections of a junior level circuits course was converted to a flipped course as a beta test for this concept. Over the last few years, lectures in the course by the author have been converted into smaller learning objects, resulting in videos of less than 10 minutes. In many cases, a lesson may be comprised of 3-4 of these videos. The videos were created using Camtasia Relay, and uploaded to a Course Management System webpage (using Moodle), in a structured sequence. While many of these videos were created from previous PowerPoint slides developed by the author, many others were created using a specialized paper tablet called PAPERSHOW, which enables screen capture and video while writing on this tablet. Over 50 videos were created for this course, and each week students were expected to review the videos related to the upcoming week's topics. Assessments were developed for learning outcomes for each week, along with assessments on the students' perception of the effectiveness on the video material. This paper will describe the process of creating these videos, the structure of the course, and a summary of the assessments of both the student learning and the perceived effectiveness of this process. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in technology and in ideology have unlocked entirely new directions for education research. Mounting pressure from increasing tuition costs and free, online course offerings is opening discussion and catalyzing change in the physical classroom. The flipped classroom is at the center of this discussion. The flipped classroom is a new pedagogical method, which employs asynchronous video lectures and practice problems as homework, and active, group-based problem solving activities in the classroom. It represents a unique combination of learning theories once thought to be incompatible-active, problem-based learning activities founded upon a constructivist ideology and instructional lectures derived from direct instruction methods founded upon behaviorist principles. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of prior and ongoing research of the flipped classroom. Studies are characterized on several dimensions. Among others, these include the type of in-class and out-of-class activities, the measures used to evaluate the study, and methodological characteristics for each study. Results of this survey show that most studies conducted to date explore student perceptions and use single-group study designs. Reports of student perceptions of the flipped classroom are somewhat mixed, but are generally positive overall. Students tend to prefer in-person lectures to video lectures, but prefer interactive classroom activities over lectures. Anecdotal evidence suggests that student learning is improved for the flipped compared to traditional classroom. However, there is very little work investigating student learning outcomes objectively. We recommend for future work studies investigating of objective learning outcomes using controlled experimental or quasi-experimental designs. We also recommend that researchers carefully consider the theoretical framework used to guide the design of in-class activities. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The technology used to generate mechanical drawings has evolved significantly in the last few years. The CAD (Computer Aided Design) software not only provides fast and efficient tools to generate these mechanical drawings, but provides tools for design review and evaluation. The designer of today must understand the design intent and constraint requirements of the part and/or assembly being created. It is critical that these concepts be incorporated into the existing drafting and design course without neglecting the fundamental concepts traditionally taught in this course. Time in the classroom remains constant but the content has increased to include the use of software. Although the technology has evolved significantly, the fundamental principles of drafting and design have not changed. This course was designed to cover the fundamental concepts of drafting and design while incorporating the forward thinking and preplanning of the part and/or assembly required by the new CAD technology. In general, the drafting and design world has undergone drastic technological changes. These changes have had a huge effect on technology and engineering education. The course objectives and assessments at the state level has been a subject of discussion for several years, particularly because of the fast pace change in technology and how it is reshaping the industry. This presentation/paper will explain how the use of online course content and the flipped classroom model was used to increase the amount of material presented in the classroom and enhance the learning and understanding of the student with applied skill development. For the purpose of this course the Curriculum Development Team was composed of selected instructors from across the state to create a web-based book (Portable Document Format and/or eBook) and online course that teaches the principles of drafting and design at the process level to promote curriculum acceptance and implementations from K-12 to Post-Secondary Education. The team members of this project were given the task to teach the underlying basic principles of drafting in generic terms and then supply some supplemental training specific to each CAD software package. This approach treats the specific CAD software as just a tool to learn the process so the student can solve the problem much like a calculator is to math (just a tool, it does not matter if it is a Casio or an HP). The knowledge and application assessments will be process based, not based on specific software. This will provide some freedom or variety between the USHE programs attempting to supply students that are more specific to a certain industry. The team members see this proposal as an opportunity to help solve this problem. One of the major contributions of such a curriculum is that the book will be accessible as online course, which is in accordance with the current state objectives for both the pre-engineering and drafting technology programs. This is unique as this method will provide consistency in content in every school in the state. In other words, every school within the State will be using the same book, objectives, and outcomes for a concurrent enrollment class accepted by every state college/university. There are several benefits for both schools and students while using this online book. One, it will provide information early enough (via a link to higher education path) to those students who are keen to enter a career in an engineering profession early in their education, regardless of their geographic location. Two, this book focuses more on the process therefore concern about the contents being out of date is not an issue. Three, although CAD software is required for this course, however, each lesson applies techniques and skills that are not dependent on the version of the CAD software and any version (release) of that software. The book will be accessible through online course delivery. The entire course was developed around the state objectives for both the pre-engineering and drafting technology programs. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years we have witnessed a resurgence of learner-centered techniques in the college classroom-though not predominantly in the Computer Science classroom. Of all, Peer Instruction (PI) and Team-Based Learning (TBL) have proven themselves as the top two most successful evidence-based, interactive teaching methods. Both have been shown to cut failure rate in introductory classes by half (or more) while increasing self-reported learner satisfaction. However, as peer-based learning techniques with similar aims and outcomes but sharply different individual characteristics, they seem to be located at opposite ends of a spectrum for convenience of implementation. PI's minimal overhead in classroom management and overall setup is partly responsible for its recent, increasingly rapid, acceptance in Computer Science classes. TBL is a slightly more involved technique that however solves the free-riding problem: individuals participating in TBL develop a heightened sense of accountability and motivation. Neither can be reduced to the other, but in this paper I show that teams for TBL can be formed instantaneously during the first lecture in such an efficient and transparent way that it becomes comparable to the simplicity that makes PI so attractive. This process can be applied successfully prima facie (during the first day of class) to any group of any composition and size but is particularly effective if coupled with a series of classroom activities that can be used in the first lecture to jumpstart TBL in a CS0/CS1/CS2 type of course. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The rapid leaps and advancements in technology have given rise to an increased use of technology in classrooms of UAE based Schools, Colleges and Universities. The classroom flip is a switch in the traditional teaching pedagogy wherein the students can listen to or watch the lecture at home and they do the homework in the classroom in presence of the faculty. This recommends a 360° change to the current teaching practices. Some of the Colleges and Universities in the UAE have started using flipped classroom. The research was aimed to distinguish between the preferences of the classroom style by having a comparative study of the traditional and flip classrooms. The collected data was tabulated and analyzed using statistical methods. Research findings formulated using discussions. The results of the research should be very beneficial for universities and colleges to recognize the learning preferences of the students. This may help them to consider the use of latest technologies to provide students with blended learning experience. On basis of the findings of this research, academicians could consider different options of using the technology to provide a better learning environment by effective utilization of technology to implement the concept of the flipped class. © 2013 IEEE. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In a flipped classroom, learning materials are made available to students for self-learning before class starts, while in-class time is used for student-teacher interaction. In this paper, we consider the role of concept maps created by the teacher in three different ways: a) as learning materials for students in a flipped classroom, b) as an organizational tool for the knowledge representation, and c) as an assessment method in which the questions are created for each concept so that the teacher is able to identify which concept the student has not grasped properly. This methodology was implemented in a pilot study with final year MCA students. The preliminary findings are extremely positive, further research work is in progress and large-scale experimentation is planned. © 2013 IEEE. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A major issue facing higher education is whether students truly know how to use this technology, can our learning spaces support it, and can it be integrated with other technologies to extend students' capabilities? This paper focuses on the how Winona State University went about improving learning spaces on campus. It includes six major sections. First, the development of the e-Warrior: Digital Life and Learning Program and Technology Master Plan provided the foundation. Second, quantifying the quality of classroom spaces on campus through the development of an online database and a campus report card provided a common point of reference. Third, faculty members engaged in the design of new learning spaces on campus to align design with pedagogy. Fourth, new technologies supported the online delivery of what used to be classroom lecture, paving the way for classroom flipping. Fifth, the intersection between formal and informal learning spaces played a role in instruction. Sixth, WSU developed two new flipped classrooms; the Math Achievement Center and Visual Media Studio. The Math Achievement Center and Visual Media Studio are collaborative classrooms designed by faculty that demonstrate the potential of mobile computing integration. Finally, recommendations for improving learning spaces found on any campus are offered. This paper provides a replicable roadmap for developing collaborative technology learning environments and highlights the many successes and challenges you may experience along the way.

	abstract = {In traditional approaches to teaching engineering classes, the instructor plays the role of information conveyor, while the students assume a receiver role with primary responsibilities of listening and note-taking. Research into how students learn suggests that students need to be more actively engaged with the course material to maximize their understanding. The literature contains many examples of active learning strategies, such as teams solving problems in class and the use of student response systems with conceptual questions. Incorporating active learning strategies into a class means that there will be less time for delivering material via lecture. Therefore, instructors who choose to utilize active learning strategies must find ways to ensure that all required course content is still addressed. This paper discusses an instructional technique called the "classroom flip" model which was assessed in a larger, undergraduate architectural engineering class. In this model, lecture content is removed from the classroom to allow time for active learning, and the content that was removed is delivered to students via on-line video. This approach 'flips' the traditional use of lecture and more active learning approaches. Lecture occurs outside of class, and more active learning, such as problem solving, happens during class. Assessment data was collected to examine students' use of the video lectures and perceptions of the classroom flip. The students' feedback suggests that while the active learning and additional project time available in class improved their understanding, they would prefer that only about half the classes be flipped and some use of traditional lectures should be maintained. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2009. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},
